Guys is Math10b rlly hard,2023-12-30 21:00:57,Purple_wisdom_,HarkerBarker,Depends on who you have. I actually did much better in 10B than 10A. Just study and try to really understand the material because what you learn in week 1 will be important for the entire quarter.
Guys is Math10b rlly hard,2023-12-30 21:00:57,Purple_wisdom_,sakiamane,I haven‚Äôt taken it yet but from my friends I‚Äôve heard that 10B is way harder than 10A.
Guys is Math10b rlly hard,2023-12-30 21:00:57,Purple_wisdom_,InfernicBoss,10b was way worse for me and my friends i cant lie. couldve just been the professor i guess though
Guys is Math10b rlly hard,2023-12-30 21:00:57,Purple_wisdom_,Mousefire777,"Been a while since I took it, but I don‚Äôt recall it being that much worse than 10A. You have to know vectors well from 10A, and the more comfortable you are with single variable integrals, the easier learning multi variable integrals will be"
Guys is Math10b rlly hard,2023-12-30 21:00:57,Purple_wisdom_,AcquiescentAxolotl,"Had it with Qi Zhang. Legit the hardest math class I‚Äôve had as an ME major. Managed to get an A bc the TA (Sean Wakasa) was very helpful. Like other ppl have said, highly dependent on your professor but if you have Sean you‚Äôre chillin"
Guys is Math10b rlly hard,2023-12-30 21:00:57,Purple_wisdom_,Horror-Ad2573,10b ain‚Äôt hard but you‚Äôll have to study and try getting a good TA
Guys is Math10b rlly hard,2023-12-30 21:00:57,Purple_wisdom_,NaveenRavindar,Highly depends on the professor. 10B was the easiest math class I have ever had and it was super easy to grasp all of the material due to the professor. That same quarter another 10B class struggled because the professor was terrible. The material itself is relatively straightforward and can be a bit tedious at times but I don‚Äôt believe the material is harder than 10A. 10B uses 9C and 10A and can be pretty intuitive if you visualize what is going on (Geogebra is your best friend). Review matrices/matrix math and you should be fine.
Guys is Math10b rlly hard,2023-12-30 21:00:57,Purple_wisdom_,Competitive_Oil6065,10b was way easier for me than 10a

Transfer from uc to community college,2023-12-30 12:34:58,Ok-External-,antwan_benjamin,"Its more or less the same process as transferring from CC to UCR. Apply to your new school as a transfer student, send your transcripts through parchment. The new school will review it and give you credit for the classes that transfer. Double-check with assist.org to make sure they get it right.  

Financial aid doesn't ""transfer"" you apply for financial aid through your new school and you get a different award."

Transfer from uc to community college,2023-12-30 12:34:58,Ok-External-,Longjumping-Air-2758,"as someone who withdrawn from UCR to a CC this fall 2023, you‚Äôd have to add the new school to ur FAFSA form to get award for that school. my CC tuition was covered fully by aid but that could depends on the school. 

but to withdraw from UCR full term, make sure you look at the deadline, which is usually the last day of instructions of fall quarter. now this is kinda complicated if u want to transfer ur credits from UCR TO CC because the deadline doesn‚Äôt let you take your finals since finals week happens after the last day of instruction. (so i basically withdrawn with no creditüò≠ but it is what it is and i had fun while being there so ig that makes up for it LMAO). most importantly, talk to financial aid bc you might get penalized and owe money to your aid. (in this case, i didn‚Äôt owe anything) but make sure to talk with your FA counselor.

if you‚Äôre a first year living in the dorm, definitely talk to housing because there‚Äôs contract cancellation fee and penalty rent."

Financial aid advice,2023-12-29 12:54:55,GeneralSyrup2398,warren_G16,Go to award offer in fin aid portal and look at the award disbursement schedule.

Why are the dorms closed?,2023-12-28 23:37:01,zlickk,DHTGK,"One reason is probably a lack of food. It'd probably be a legal nightmare to close all the dining places, but keep students in the dorms. Who can't cook due to a lack of kitchen, and likely rely on eating out.

The counterargument would probably just be to keep dining options open, but I'm pretty sure there'd be a low amount of workers to even keep one dining hall going. Most people would head home for winter break."

Why are the dorms closed?,2023-12-28 23:37:01,zlickk,HoneyBunny0-0,Well dinning hall won‚Äôt be open and dorm doesn‚Äôt have kitchen (minus pentland but imagine the entire building trying to use 1 stove). Also most freshman doesn‚Äôt have a car/transportation or money to get food everyday. And the most important thing is that your housing contract starts on the 7th. U can stay during the break but im pretty sure there‚Äôs a day-rate which is like $65 per day or something. Definitely not worth it

Will I get in,2023-12-28 00:19:33,AssistanceOne4564,[deleted],you'll get accepted they might change your major until you pass prereqs but should be good

UCR's major switch process is so easy especially as a freshman so by my 2nd quarter I was already taking cs classes and in my 3rd quarter of my first year I succesfully switched to CS. So if you get in with your alternate major switching is almost guaranteed."

Will I get in,2023-12-28 00:19:33,AssistanceOne4564,[deleted],"Yes there's a clarification I want to make though. Major choice has no impact on admission, just what major you're admitted under 

OP will most likely get in, he has the stats for getting in here. He most likely won't get in with cs, those are the figures you're stating. He'll most likely get his second choice major and can later do well in prereqs to switch."

For OP as a CS major, yes it will be a tough admit but they do not list an alternate major so that is why I asked."
Will I get in,2023-12-28 00:19:33,AssistanceOne4564,GullibleActuary1229,"Sorry a business major. With your stats you‚Äôll most likely get accepted, but you‚Äôll probably be accepted in as a different major (this happened to like 2 friends of mine) but as long as you know u want to switch majors the process is pretty easy"
Will I get in,2023-12-28 00:19:33,AssistanceOne4564,[deleted],You'll prob get let in as your second major and they'll give you a plan to switch into your first major once you pass the prereqs

Will I get in,2023-12-28 00:19:33,AssistanceOne4564,AssistanceOne4564,Wait what does open major mean
Will I get in,2023-12-28 00:19:33,AssistanceOne4564,AssistanceOne4564,What if I don‚Äôt have business as my alternate major? Will this still happen?
Will I get in,2023-12-28 00:19:33,AssistanceOne4564,GullibleActuary1229,"Doesn‚Äôt need to be business, just once you get in, look into the prereqs to transfer from your majors college to BCOE, which is the engineering college. As long as you aren‚Äôt an art major or something, the process is pretty simple. Just gotta complete a bunch of clssses and get I think a 3.0 in all the classes. The classes aren‚Äôt incredibly difficult so it shouldn‚Äôt be hard to get a 3.0. But you have to complete all prereqs within your first year, BCOE doesn‚Äôt allow major transfers in after first year."
Will I get in,2023-12-28 00:19:33,AssistanceOne4564,AssistanceOne4564,Okok also I‚Äôve heard a few people say that ucr offers people open majors what does that mean if Yk what that is
Will I get in,2023-12-28 00:19:33,AssistanceOne4564,GullibleActuary1229,"Same thing that I said earlier about the business major, if you‚Äôre not qualified enough for the impacted major you applied for, but you‚Äôre qualified to get in, then they‚Äôll accept you with a different major than you applied with. Open majors are pretty much majors that aren‚Äôt impacted and ones that the school can add people too without setting off the balance, such as business"
Will I get in,2023-12-28 00:19:33,AssistanceOne4564,AssistanceOne4564,Okay let‚Äôs say that they don‚Äôt let me in as a data sci or cs major right but they say that I‚Äôm qualified to get in ucr they‚Äôll pick a random major for me does that sound right?
Will I get in,2023-12-28 00:19:33,AssistanceOne4564,GullibleActuary1229,"Yea about right, not random but a less impacted major. Also looking at your stats you‚Äôll at least get waitlisted, so you‚Äôre most likely to get in. As long as you get into the school the major switch is doable as long as u know what to do from the start"
Will I get in,2023-12-28 00:19:33,AssistanceOne4564,AssistanceOne4564,Hmm okok

How hard is CS10C?,2023-12-27 05:23:25,night-gale,DreamersDeal,"This class, Data Structures and Algorithms, teaches you the intro material for leetcode. 

if you're planning to intern somewhere computer science related, pay attention. this class gives you tools to pass those interviews. 

in terms of difficulty, I'd say it's harder than earlier cs classes as it builds on top of those but most of the concepts learned are rather easy to understand, but coding those concepts may be different. 

good luck, you'll do great !"

I know you mentioned about not going to grad school, but as someone who chose to go get my Master‚Äôs degree it has tremendously changed my life for the better. I got my BA in English, so jobs I was looking was limiting. Once I got accepted into a Master‚Äôs program, I was able to connect with people who are in the same field as me and work with professors who are very helpful and has given me connections in my field. I was able to teach my first university class, which now makes my resume look better and gave me more experience. 

What people don‚Äôt seem to mention is that grad school helps a lot with getting better job connections and overall, you‚Äôll come out of it much more knowledgeable. My experience at grad school has been positive, and much more laid back than getting a Bachelor‚Äôs. I got a full-ride financial aid to cover the cost of grad school, so for me it‚Äôs been worth it. You should defiantly check out some schools and ask Fafsa about the costs. You also don‚Äôt need to go a UC for grad school. A lot of people I know decided to go from UC to Cal-State just to earn their Master‚Äôs. 

At the end, it‚Äôs your personal choice if you want to go back to school. It‚Äôs some things to consider and what I can share as someone who decided going back to school was the best thing for me after graduating from UCR."

I 100 percent peaked in college and I‚Äôm struggling :(,2023-12-27 00:01:37,Luigi-The-Weenie,HaikusfromBuddha,"Graduated I think 2020 when Covid happened. Didn‚Äôt get to walk the stage because of it. Didn‚Äôt have the best gpa. With this in mind I joined some clubs and jobs that would be relevant to my field CS.

It was enough to differentiate myself and I was able to land a good job. I bought a home earlier this year(How? In the IE that‚Äôs how) and I think I can pay it off in two years if I just keep my expenses low and stay at my parents house every other day.

I think the best move financially, if your mental health isn‚Äôt in jeopardy at your parents home, is to stay there.

Save up as much as you can.

I don‚Äôt have many hobbies besides video games. So my days just consist of work and trying to build up the furniture in my house.

Have I peaked? I don‚Äôt think so. I never thought I‚Äôd be in the position I am now so I‚Äôm setting new goals. 

After my house is paid off I‚Äôll try saving up for a crazy car.

I think the only thing that would put a wrench in my life/lifestyle is if I find a significant other. I‚Äôm not really focused on that. 

Most of my life was spent taking care of siblings so I kind of want a couple of years of just me time. Being a lazy Mfker. Wake up late during the weekends. Watch TikTok ungodly hours.

Idk maybe some people frown upon that but it makes me happy.


As for OP. Do you currently have a job in your major? 20k seems awfully low. My job search pretty much showed me GPA doesn‚Äôt matter. Experience and people who you know matter. I‚Äôm not sure if a graduate degree is worth it unless you know for a fact you can‚Äôt get a job without it.

I had friends much smarter than me, much better gpas, some with Masters Degrees struggle to get jobs after graduation.

I think it‚Äôs just a relentless numbers game. Apply. Don‚Äôt stop applying. Reach out to recruiters. Try to get experience in your area any way possible. I was sending out more than a hundred applications per week. I only got like 6 responses.

I swear earlier this year I received a rejection letter from some application I sent in 2020."

I 100 percent peaked in college and I‚Äôm struggling :(,2023-12-27 00:01:37,Luigi-The-Weenie,rjvalenz,"I hear you and don't worry about peaks in your life. I do hope and wish you enjoy the ""process"" of growing, developing, and doing what is meaningful for you. Explore! The world is vast no matter where you're at.   


My story - I graduated from UCR a little over a decade ago and while there, I was part of Greek life, sociological research and eventually traveling and moving abroad to Spain and Italy to do research. That led to my food and wine-tasting career for about \~2 years in Italy. I fell out of love with that career and broke up with my partner to move back and try to start a career in San Francisco. Then starting my career in tech - and ironically that was when like you, I felt a feeling of losing my peak because I went from being that big fish in a small pond, to entering the grand ocean where everyone was brilliant. You kind of get stuck in a role while working in tech/startups and I felt burnt out. Eventually started a nonprofit tech and sold that off, came back to work at a couple more startups and big-name tech companies. And here I am now, part of big tech layoffs last year to spend time away from it to heal from corporate toxicity, terrible office politics, and capitalism exploiting us. It's been nice to do creative endeavors like officiating weddings around the world, woodworking, sneaker making, and really spending meaningful time with people who matter to me.   


Advice to you: it's ok to feel the way you do. Life comes in waves, you'll have your highs and lows, and there will be lulls and higher peaks than before. The beauty is that no matter what point you're at, you'll have perspective. With that perspective, I hope you learn to accept the privileges that come with circumstances so that you discover new paths and opportunities (I grew up as an immigrant and low-income kid - so it's insane to me that I was ever given a shot to build my life to where it's at now by using tech space as a stepping stone). I understand that money, title, and status can impact your perspective - but I hope you rewire that thinking of success into something that's more catered to you. Do what is meaningful, let the money and status be an afterthought, and always stay curious even in the most toxic circumstances."

Nothings lost yet, you already great at recognizing what‚Äôs going wrong (not everyone has the balls to admit it), it‚Äôs time to do something about it. 

And about your plans for 2024, I don‚Äôt wanna indulge in your personal but if I were I probably wouldn‚Äôt move in with a partner that makes me feel bad for making significantly less. I‚Äôm not saying anything bad about your partner, but it stings like a bee knowing you‚Äôre no where close to making at least half of what they make. Just my 0.02

I saw some guy create a login c++ app for a club where they just needed to swipe their student Id and the basic terminal c++ program logged them in attendance.

Just pitch something to any club you‚Äôre interested in. Maybe do it with friends so you guys could release a viable project that can be mainted by future students.

This is a question that is really a case-by-case basis.

For example, do you have undergrad loans or car loans you need to take care of? Phone bills? Insurance? Are you supporting someone else somehow?"

Update I'm dropping out of UCR and I am joining the Military.,2023-12-26 10:46:19,[deleted],Accomplished_King747,Just join the national guard. Same benefits and you can go to school at the same time. It's what I did.
Update I'm dropping out of UCR and I am joining the Military.,2023-12-26 10:46:19,[deleted],Combat_Commo,"I think that‚Äôs a good decision. I joined the military when I was 23! Was doing CC part time while working full time but didn‚Äôt like it. This was in 2000 going into the summer of 2001 right before 911 happened. 

Then 911 happened. I hated school and work and really couldn‚Äôt find myself so I decided to join during this unique time in our country‚Äôs history.

I joined the Army because I wanted to be a Paratrooper and it was not easy. I did 1 tour in Afghanistan and came back. Went through really tough times both physically and on a personal level but it makes it feel so much worth it.

I think that going to the Military is a good option. You‚Äôll have more education benefits on top of your existing ones! Plus, if you happened to get hurt‚Ä¶you can get disability compensation so make sure you keep copies and a journal of your injuries.

It‚Äôll be a good experience as long as you make the most out of it. Don‚Äôt do National Guard or Reserves, go active to get full benefits."

Update I'm dropping out of UCR and I am joining the Military.,2023-12-26 10:46:19,[deleted],AmateurCubz,"If your going national guard then you should try doing Community College at the same time, after basic you'll only be working 2 days a month and 2 weeks a year plus you won't qualify for the post 911 gi bill which is the really useful one."
Update I'm dropping out of UCR and I am joining the Military.,2023-12-26 10:46:19,[deleted],ongeku,"Depending on what job you sign up for in the National Guard, you can still do both guard and UCR.

I took a leave of absence from UCR for the fall quarter and went to basic and advanced training. Came back to UCR after I completed both those trainings, and just did my weekend drills and 2 week summer annual training until I graduated on time.

The only regret I had was picking a military job by training length (4 weeks of advanced training for mine). Don't do that- pick a job that you'll enjoy and perhaps has some transferability into the civilian world.

But overall, it was a great decision that set me up for the rest of college and getting into my first civilian full time role. Having the Montgomery GI bill and the GI Bill kicker ($750/mo at the time) and having priority class registration was great. My deployment right after college gave me a lot of operational experience that really set me apart for employers, being a fresh grad.

tl;dr, you don't have to drop out to do the guard or any part time military service. Work with the UCR veteran's office to make sure you get set up with a leave of absence for your initial training"

pls drop advice for cs010cüò≠üôè,2023-12-25 12:46:52,Then-Cartographer695,instantramen045,"I just took 10c with Patrick Miller (great prof btw!) and got an A! Here‚Äôs my advice:

1. Start the labs and programming assignments at least 3 days before the due date. Spend day 1 getting familiar with what it‚Äôs asking for, day 2 on the code, and day 3 on edge cases and working out the kinks. Most of assignments WILL take multiple hours, so don‚Äôt torture yourself by trying to cram it like I did for the first few assignments üíÄ

2. Take advantage of SI if you can! You‚Äôll meet people who are happy to help when you get stuck (and you will, most definitely, get stuck.)

3. Miller is teaching all of the sections next quarter. I HIGHLY recommend going to his office hours, which he treats more like a mini-lecture. He‚Äôll go over the most challenging parts of the lab/programming assignment of that week, and when the midterm and final come up he‚Äôll even work on problems that show up word-for-word on the exams. I had a class that overlapped with his office hours that I ended up skipping pretty often because that how helpful his office hours were. 

4. Don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out to Miller directly! It might seem a bit intimidating at first, but he really enjoys helping his students. I‚Äôd also recommend reserving one-on-one office hours meet-ups before midterms and finals in advance, even if you don‚Äôt have any questions at the moment. His slots would always fill up a week before the exams this quarter, so you were out of luck if you had any last-minute questions. Better to not need a slot you reserved and cancel it then to need one and not have any available. 

5. Although you do a lot of programming in this class, the core of it are the abstract data concepts. Understanding those concepts is more important than writing perfect code, especially on the exams, where he is very liberal with partial credit. Even if your answer is totally wrong, explaining the concept on the side will get you some points back (and with that 70% cutoff, every point counts!)

Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions! Good luck :)"

tamed a donkey,2023-12-24 21:07:44,Ok-Variety8603,No_Cartographer931,I've only seen like 1 or two donkeys on campus but I'm pretty sure it's actually illegal to get on them and start riding them. My friend did it for like half a mile after we worked out at SRC and then got stopped by police. Apparently some local farmer has a bunch and sometimes they slip out of the gate. Consider yourself lucky that you didn't get arrested

Kappa Sigma is not recognized by UCR at all. For that matter, they‚Äôve actually been condemned by various guilds for their hazing practices. If Kappa Sigma is not a fraternity affiliated with UCR in any way, why should Kappa Sigma be allowed to form a de-facto political party and continue voting their own into power while maintaining a chokehold over a community they‚Äôre not even a part of? This is in fact, a dishonest act, in accordance with Cambridge‚Äôs definition of rigging. 

On another note, a fraternity who was condemned for vandalizing other organizations with hate symbols does not deserve to be defended, be their elections rigged or not.

Do the women here care about being approached by unattractive guys?,2023-12-24 17:28:11,PlasticYoung2031,tryingtobeadoctor234,"Well this goes into sex theory, men and women can fall into the role of pursuer and perused. Putting aside the fact that being more dominating or submissive in relationships are dependent on the individuals personal preferences, in your example the man is interacting with the woman based off of intention of getting to know them sparked by physical attraction. That is fine. The line, in my opinion, is when the man in this scenario doesn‚Äôt care about who she is only what she can do or give him. Being viewed as a full person compared to a sex object, intentions here are everything. My advice is focus on seeing someone who you like physically and going to talk to them to get to know them, not just get or expect sex from them. This leads to resentment from men towards women who they think are holding out on them for no reason other than looks or money or something trivial. There are people who are more than willing to do the hook up one night stand agreement, just be upfront and honest about it. It‚Äôs the men who want to turn every woman into that regardless of who they are or what they may want."
Do the women here care about being approached by unattractive guys?,2023-12-24 17:28:11,PlasticYoung2031,TriG__,"""A chokehold over a community their not a part of"".  
What? A: They are a part of the UCR community so I don't really understand this. B: what chokehold? You say this like they're funneling money into their own accounts or writing legislation for their own benefit. Do you actually know how ASUCR works? Kappa sigma members are a minority within ASUCR, so I find this highly unlikely to happen in the first place as everything is voted on by the whole senate. Additionally, all legislation and funding passed by ASUCR is open to the public to look at, so you can read through all of it. I guarantee you don't find a single thing of note in relation to Kappa Sigma.  
  
Just because Kappa Sigma has never been on IFC at UCR doesn't mean they're some underground band of thugs or something like you're making it out to be. UCR's Kappa Sigma chapter is actually a top ranked chapter nationally within the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Unrecognized =/= dismissed. In your citation you linked the list of dismissed and unrecognized organizations. If you actually read the page, you'll quickly realize that the dismissed organizations are the ones who have been caught in malicious activities, and thus violates school policy to join. You'll notice that Kappa Sigma falls under the unrecognized section. This simply means that they've never been on the schools IFC. Nothing more. So anything relating to that which you've mentioned is moot (I notice you didn't cite your 'condemned by various guilds'). Sadly I think I'll need to spell it out for you: 'Why should they be allowed to participate in ASUCR?' because they are UCR students and are not in any violation of any school policy by being in Kappa Sigma, nor do their members in ASUCR violate any policies which would result in their removal. This is why they are allowed to LMAO.  
  
I honestly find it hard to believe that in your comment you bring up what another Kappa Sigma chapter at another school did. Like I don't even know where to begin, that is just a complete lack of critical thinking on your part. To act like each chapter of a fraternity is at all similar from campus to campus is laughably stupid. Putting that in your argument is just so incredibly irrelevant if you're trying to talk about a specific chapter of a fraternity.  
  
If you choose to ignore everything I just said, I would implore you to direct your questions/frustrations to any of the professional faculty working with/for ASUCR. I'm positive they could quash your very misguided qualms.  
  
Also I think you should change your username haha, thanks for playing my game though, friend :)"

Do the women here care about being approached by unattractive guys?,2023-12-24 17:28:11,PlasticYoung2031,tryingtobeadoctor234,"But attractiveness is subjective. There are people with all types of preferences that don‚Äôt fit the conventional attractive features. If the woman isn‚Äôt attracted to you based solely off of looks I would think that‚Äôs a red flag in general. But if you want to be considered conventionally attractive so you‚Äôd have more options to choose from or better yet have those picky shallow women pick you because you met their standards is a losing battle.  Even if they pick you why would you value their opinion when they themselves are shallow and only good for looks or status symbols. The question here is what are you looking for and why, is it just for sex then you‚Äôll fall into this cycle of unattainable standards to get a shallow man or woman. If you actually want a relationship it really doesn‚Äôt matter how you look because someone will find you attractive ( good hygiene goes a long way). Out of 8 Billion people there will be a couple thousand who would think your drop dead hot. We can never get self esteem boosts from others it‚Äôs short lived and unsatisfying. Confidence and love of yourself has to come from you. And that sort of confidence will translate with your flirting or talking to someone you like."

For me, a woman can have the best personality, but if I am not attracted to her physical appearance, then she is going to find out and get hurt.  Just like how it is not enough for guys to be ""nice,"" it is not enough for a woman just to have a great personality.  She needs to be physically attractive is she is expecting a guy to exhaust himself to have the extra qualities she is looking for.

I think OP would like to meet the conventionally ""attractive"" women, because he just is not going to exhaust himself to meet the standards of conventionally unattractive women.  Not all unattractive women have this particular woman's mindset and delusion, but this old, haggard, unattractive woman is of the opinion that a man should exhaust himself to meet her standards.  What man is going to exhaust himself just to have sex with an ugly woman like her?

Do the women here care about being approached by unattractive guys?,2023-12-24 17:28:11,PlasticYoung2031,TriG__,"Because people in this subreddit are always falsely clamoring about Kappa Sigma corrupting ASUCR or rigging elections. Having actually served in ASUCR, I know how completely untrue and out of the realm of possibilities all of it is. I feel that not only is it unfair to members of Kappa Sigma in ASUCR (which I understand nobody here cares about at all), but it needlessly creates distrust in ASUCR itself. No matter the subject, baseless defamation really bothers me.  
  
To me, it really does mirror Trump supporters' fanaticism to a lesser degree, especially around election time. Always lots of vocal outrage about the aforementioned topics, yet never any actual research into the subject or proof of anything. But you're right, it's Christmas, maybe I should just make a separate post about this come election time.  
  
Merry Christmas to you and u/MrAlways_Right, I hope your family is well and in good health"

There are a lot of community colleges now totally free regardless of your status.

I ended up transferring to UCR as a transfer student and obtaining lot of scholarships and aid where I went mostly free with some work study and side work supplements.

I wasn‚Äôt formally diagnosed until after college. It was a struggle but it can be done.

I got kicked out of my first college with a 1.27 and got a 3.4 gpa in community college and finished UCR with a 2.8 it was tough.

I managed in my 30s to go to graduate school after ADHD treatment and I got a 3.8 GPA graduated with honors.

If you want to be a business owner, it's more important that you understand what need your business is filling and where/who your market is. It's easy to learn a lot of business theory from college courses, but it ultimately isn't going to help you in the long run.

Berserk 1999 (do NOT get spoiled). Watch only the 1999 version, beginning to end, English dub. Then once you‚Äôre hooked read the manga from Berninig to end and gear ready to feast on the beast piece of fiction any human being can ever make.

Anime movies are also really good, such those from Studio Ghibli (Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Howl‚Äôs Moving Castle, Grave of the Fireflies / The Boy and the Heron is currently out in theaters), Makoto Shinkai films (Your Name, Garden of Words, 5 Centimeters Per Second, and more recently, Suzume no Tojimari), and Satoshi Kon films (Paprika, Perfect Blue, Tokyo Godfathers).

Anime style games are also really good. Mobile games such as Genshin Impact, Fate/GO (including the Fate series anime), and Arknights. You can also go for more detailed content and creative games for consoles and PC such as Danganronpa (which has an anime series), the Persona series (which also has an anime), and Fire Emblem.

Just a few suggestions that have yet to be mentioned, but I think are still worth going into. Of course, if you‚Äôre an anime fan, always check out the mangas of your favorite anime‚Äôs, as well as some new ones that will be getting anime adaptations soon such as Kaiju No. 8, Dandadan, and Blue Box."

HOW SHOULD I TAKE NOTES,2023-12-22 18:10:34,Remarkable-War-11,Mountain-Nebula2441,"Personally, I prefer an iPad because I like having all my notes in one place on something that's easy to carry around. However, if buying one would put you in financial strain, it's not worth it and a paper and pencil will always be sufficient.

If you get an iPad for note-taking, you'd likely want one that is compatible with a pencil; this definitely is faster for taking notes compared to typing. I also recommend looking on eBay or some other resale app for a used one if you're looking to save money. Most of these sites come with some kind of buyer protection and you can get newer models for like half the price."
HOW SHOULD I TAKE NOTES,2023-12-22 18:10:34,Remarkable-War-11,ImpishNerd,"Whatever you use, something I want to recommend is try not to write everything that the instructor says down. Paper and pen, maybe iPad, are best, but it‚Äôs more important to make sure that you‚Äôre interpreting what your instructor says, getting down what you feel is the most important out of anything said. A lot of students try and cram, but that leaves out where the learning process happens, which is involved in you struggling to get down what you feel is the main theme, concepts."
HOW SHOULD I TAKE NOTES,2023-12-22 18:10:34,Remarkable-War-11,mechasmadness,"An ipad is great especially since you don't have to use a Pro model if you want to be able to use the pencil. You can use the smart folio/keyboard if you want but there's third party ones that aren't as expensive that should be able to get the job done. If it's too costly to get an iPad and the accessories, pen and paper works too."
HOW SHOULD I TAKE NOTES,2023-12-22 18:10:34,Remarkable-War-11,Just_Another_Andrew,"I was a paper note-taker for a long time but swapped over to using OneNote on a Surface. I still prefer to do problem sets on paper (it's a little more convenient to look at a past step quickly), but for general lecture notes and discussion going digital saves a ton of paper

That said, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Changing your note-taking medium isn't going to have a big effect on how well you absorb the material"

I have my previous setup I can sell you for a good price, send me a PM. It'll be MUCH cheaper than the ipad route, with more school features IMO since its fully integrated with all Office products"

But, going to your post,  If you believe going to church more often will help that's your choice and I understand it. However you don't need to be close to your faith to be better, you should be aware and knowledgeable about what resources are avaliable for you and know your limits. 

I'm going to assume you grew up with religious parents who were strict about where you went and what you did. My best advice for you is to make friends who likely are smarter and more experienced with relationships so they can offer some valuable advice if you need help. Since you said you want to become a doctor start seeking people who are already ahead of you or are about to be a doctor and ask for their advise as well. 

Regardless, I hope you're doing well and ignore the haters. Some men are toxic (as a man myself). Focus on your goals and have fun while at ucr (while being safe and legal ofc)"

I'm pregnant and I don't know what to do. (Update),2023-12-21 19:50:53,[deleted],Evanescentlyy,"Hi, current medical student here. I agree with what others have said about making an appt with the women's health center and finding an OBGYN that you can see regularly. Having a baby at a young age can be challenging especially when you arent sure what resources are out there, which is why making an appt at the women's health center is crucial.

Seeing an OBGYN will help because they can keep track of the baby throughout the pregnancy while also doing various tests to screen for certain abnormalities. This might be even more important for you because you said you drank while you were pregnant without knowing. Also, you should see them to see how much folic acid you need to be taking as it's generally recommended before pregnancy to avoid other abnormalities such as neural tube defects."

I‚Äôm starting to think this is just rage bait because it‚Äôs hard to believe that somebody could be this unintentionally obtuse.

You have mixed feelings on getting an abortion because of your Catholicism but you engage in premarital sex? It‚Äôs an odd perspective is all, which is what leads me to sense the troll-like vibes emanating from your posts and comments.

In case this isn‚Äôt a joke, listen to every sane person who has responded to you and reschedule that appointment for an abortion. That kid‚Äôs life has a high chance of sucking donkey balls, open adoption or otherwise. The adoption system is fucked, the chances of your child being abused by the adopting family are not low by any means, and an open adoption can become closed *real* quick. And don‚Äôt forget that it is up to *you* to prevent that."

I'm pregnant and I don't know what to do. (Update),2023-12-21 19:50:53,[deleted],Jamonde,"You need to understand that with this decision, you are bringing an entire person into this world. Your concern shouldn't be 'what are my parents going to say?', but not because that isn't important - because they are likely going to find out in some way, shape, or form. I hope that you can be honest with yourself and with them. You may need to go to them before you even know who the father is. Can you do that?

There's a lot that you need to talk about here, and I suggest you see a counselor, a doctor (OBGYN probably), and someone from the women's resource center at MINIMUM. You've made it abundantly obvious that you aren't really in a position to be a mother yet, and I think input from a doctor on health-related things is essential.

Not that it needs to be over-emphasized, but a common issue with a lot of folks who are raised Catholic in this country is that they 'don't believe in birth control/protection', or their parents/schools don't, so they don't get educated about proper sexual/reproductive health, yet still go out and have sex anyways. I am not condemning you, but I want to make clear that pregnancy is one of the things that can happen. You may also wish to seek out tests for common STI's, as the pull-out method definitely won't protect against those. Please, take your sexual health education seriously now that it's not just your life at stake anymore."

I'm pregnant and I don't know what to do. (Update),2023-12-21 19:50:53,[deleted],According-Ear-9963,"Girl I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend going to the Women's Health Services and educating yourself on what exactly will happen if you have that baby. That comment you responded to about open adoptions is very misleading. Many people believe that open adoption is a type of relationship in which the adoptive family and birth parents meet frequently in person. They may envision constant phone calls and adoptive parents consulting with the birth mother on all parenting decisions. However, the truth is that an open adoption is not co-parenting, and once you give your child up, you are not its parent and your life will not be as entwined as you thought in your last comment.

I recommend that you carefully reconsider your decision and get an abortion. Having a baby already takes an immense toll on your body, but giving your child up for adoption will affect your mind and your hormones even more. You're still young, you have a life ahead of you, and you should not be going through this as a college freshman. One of the many positives of living in California is our pro-choice open-mindedness ‚Äî **TAKE advantage of California's wide availability of abortion clinics**. Don't tell your parents. You don't have the means to take care of a child right now and dropping out of school will be a very big mistake in the long run. Graduate, get a degree and your life sorted. Become a doctor. It will be extremely difficult if you have that child, believe me.

One last thing, I cannot stress how important contraception is. I don't agree with the comments slutshaming you. You made a bad decision, I hope you learned your mistake. Sex is a natural human impulse, and you should not be shamed for something that we praise men for. However, while there's nothing wrong with having sex, there is something wrong with not using contraception. Birth control, IUD, Plan B, whatever. BUT DO SOMETHING. You can get contraception at the WELL for free. Please take advantage of it. And even with whatever contraception you're on, also make sure that the dude ur sleeping with has a condom. ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU'RE HAVING SEX WHEN HE HAS A CONDOM ON!!! I wish you the best of luck!!

&#x200B;

p.s. Make good decisions abt the men u sleep with at UCR. I can tell u that these frat dudes at parties do not gaf and are only looking to get in your pants. Even birth control can't stop you from getting an STD."

Fuck my religion if it means I get laid, but now I have to consider it when this kid who I clearly am not capable of taking care of could lead an awful life.

This is in no way guilt-tripping. I have no reason to guilt-trip; this will not affect me in any way whatsoever in the long run. This is just an admonition. OP can ignore everyone here and ruin the kid's life if that is truly what her heart desires. But she asked for advice earlier, so people are going to give it to her.

I would feel bad but from my understanding I would say we both made decisions and she has to deal with her decisions alone. It takes two to tango but if the other person is tangoing with everyone and their brother, then whose responsibility is the consequences really? It's harsh but that's the male perspective, and having that perspective does not make you a deadbeat but a reasonable skeptic."
I'm pregnant and I don't know what to do. (Update),2023-12-21 19:50:53,[deleted],Datsmellstightdawg,"Not wrong as I know someone who has gone through it. Baby was fine and does not have fetal alcohol syndrome you telling her her baby is definitely going to have fetal alcohol syndrome is not true. Also in some countries, like France, alcohol more particularly wine is actually common in pregnant women. As I mentioned before it is not uncommon for people to not know they are pregnant it‚Äôs actually pretty common, I was at a conference for school and I was talking to 2 classmates of mine who both didn‚Äôt know they were pregnant for awhile. In the major that I‚Äôm in everyone is hardcore drinkers both are their babies were born fine. Should it be normalized? No. Should we shame people who didn‚Äôt know they were pregnant and drank alcohol? Also no."
I'm pregnant and I don't know what to do. (Update),2023-12-21 19:50:53,[deleted],Datsmellstightdawg,"Right and I‚Äôm not saying that yeah alcohol is 100% safe during pregnancy so go crazy and drink all day every day. People should absolutely not risk it and not drink at all. But in cases where you don‚Äôt know you are pregnant, which is pretty common, people are going to continue their normal activities like drinking because they don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm sure OP also isn‚Äôt dumb and knows substances can affect a fetus. So it‚Äôs just really unnecessary and speculation saying ‚Äúyour baby is going to have mad fetal alcohol syndrome.‚Äù"
I'm pregnant and I don't know what to do. (Update),2023-12-21 19:50:53,[deleted],Datsmellstightdawg,"Yeah that‚Äôs why I said did OP make terrible decisions? Yes. Because she absolutely did make so many terrible decisions that also put her at high risk of developing STDs having unprotected sex with multiple people. However, sex is normal and should be treated as such. You also have to realize there is some places where sexual education is not normalized/even taught at all. There‚Äôs states in the US that are actively trying to ban sexual education in schools. So sometimes it‚Äôs not even the fault of people but lack of education. If you are never taught about safe sex or sex at all it‚Äôs impossible to be properly informed. No, we are not ignoring that having a child is a big responsibility but that is not excuse to try to force someone into having an abortion.

You do not know for certain that this child has a high chance of suffering from birth? Does it look good with what we were presented? No. But there is no guideline that we can follow to say okay this baby will suffer but this baby will not suffer. A baby can be born to a single mother and thrive more than a baby born into a family. Being around Catholics for most of my life I don‚Äôt see it as ‚Äúall of a sudden‚Äù her religion matters. Abortion is the main thing Catholics agree on. In high school we would have annual trips to march for Pro-life beliefs. For example that isn‚Äôt religious, illegal activity there are some things people view as absolute and some things people are more likely to turn a blind eye to such as stealing food because you are hungry versus murdering someone. Back to religion that‚Äôs why there is the word devout because you are committed to every aspect of the religion and follow every rule and every guideline. But you can still be a part of a religion and not be devout but follow a certain set of rules strictly. 

Being that I am a woman and having my autonomy threatened in my state I obviously don‚Äôt find a Reddit post and actual laws revoking autonomy equivalent‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not even sure how you came to that conclusion. However, language that you used can still promote these same ideals lawmakers have had that went into the making of such laws such as you saying ‚Äúlisten to sane people we know what we‚Äôre talking about about and you don‚Äôt.‚Äù What you said wasn‚Äôt phrased as an opinion at all that was a statement. An opinion is personally I think it will be difficult to raise a child and attend college. However you chose to go with listen to sane people and reschedule the abortion. See the difference?"

I wonder if that could answer as to why society looks down on women for sleeping around and less so for men. If a man is sleeping around with a bunch of different women who don't have other sexual partners the question of who the father is, is not up for the question. Meanwhile in the same exact opposite situation a woman sleeping around with multiple men is essentially playing roulette. It's not right that one is looked down upon more so than the other but there are reasons why society does not see the two to be the same because they are not the same. You don't have to come to the same value judgment as society but understanding why society comes to these judgement values is why a lot of people go to school."
I'm pregnant and I don't know what to do. (Update),2023-12-21 19:50:53,[deleted],MysterionX12,There are so many documented cases of men having to pay child support despite negative paternity tests. I'm not saying this as a misogynist thing but from a legal perspective you have to cover your ass which could mean denying any test at all which literally any lawyer would advise you to do until it was certain you have to take a test. Perhaps before calling someone a moron on Reddit maybe consider why taking a paternity test may open you up to legal responsibilities. If you aren't in a field that pertains to legal and social issues why comment? If you were you would know this...

I never said anything explicit. All I literally said is you do not know for 100% sure that this persons baby will be affected and I provided an example that I personally know. I never said alcohol is sooo safe in pregnancy everyone should get drunk and drink how much alcohol they want to. It‚Äôs obviously not safe and should be avoided but when people don‚Äôt know they are pregnant they obviously may drink. Sure the other countries aren‚Äôt backed by research that is true but if 100% of babies are not born with the syndrome you cannot say every single baby will be if a unknowing mother drinks many factors come into play.

Any advice on burnout?,2023-12-21 10:46:44,_meow_02,ChuckG04,"My advice (please read):

If you‚Äôre able to work a little less, then do so. 50+ hour  weeks is too much. Again, I understand that you need to work to go to school. If you‚Äôre unable to work less hours then you MUST find ONE day to completely rest in. Just one day. Even if you work on that day, then clear everything else so that even if you do work, you‚Äôll at least not do anything that counts as ‚Äúworking‚Äù or ‚Äústudying‚Äù. Just one day of quality rest is what you need to recharge. When I say ‚Äúrest‚Äù I mean something that you genuinely enjoy doing or gives you some sort of satisfaction. That doesn‚Äôt have to mean watching Netflix for the entire day. Resting can mean reading a book or taking a walk.

Another thing: you gotta change your mindset towards what ‚Äúwork and college‚Äù is. Is college exhausting? YES IT IS. Is work exhausting? YES IT IS. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to see them as something that is negative in your life. Try to see college and work as a means to an end. The ‚Äúend‚Äù being your long term career goal, whatever it may be.

Another thing: don‚Äôt chase money. If your long term goal is to ‚Äúmake bank‚Äù then you‚Äôre leading yourself to an empty and purposeless life. Money does not fulfill PERIOD. Make sure your long term goals are ones that will give you fulfillment and enjoyment. ‚ÄúMaking bank‚Äù won‚Äôt do that for you."

Any advice on burnout?,2023-12-21 10:46:44,_meow_02,KingDominoTheSecond,"OP,  please keep in mind that taking out loans is a LAST LAST LAST case scenario. Loans can easily ruin your life. EASILY. You could see your personal and financial growth be stunted for years if you can't keep up with the loan payments. The interest rates on a lot of these personal loans or payday loans are ridiculous too and you'd spend so much more money on those. If you end up needing to declare bankruptcy because the loan payments are too much, you will have to buy everything cash for the next 10 years, including cars and houses.

If you're working 50 hours per week and still can't afford anything, I highly recommend looking into lifestyle changes instead, maybe a different job if possible, or cutting back on expenses. Do a self audit of where you're spending money and what can be cut back. Just don't do a loan if you really don't have to, and if you do need a loan do your research please."

Any advice on burnout?,2023-12-21 10:46:44,_meow_02,KingDominoTheSecond,"""Not sure why you're so afraid of loans"" is a phrase said by someone who has no clue how easily taking out the wrong loan at the wrong time for the wrong reason could ruin your financial future. Any loans you take out must be thoroughly researched and you have to plan out exactly how you are going to pay it back. It's not just free money now in return for a monthly payment later, it's a huge financial decision and should be treated as such. Even if you're perfectly capable of paying back the loan, just the fact that you took out a loan could impact you when you go to buy a car, or a house, or if you find yourself in a major emergency where you need to use your credit for immediate funds that exceed what you could put down at the moment. Ideally you'd never have to take out a loan, but unfortunately we live in the real world where loans are sometimes necessary. But if you do need a loan, it shouldn't be supporting you just living, that's what work is for. Instead loans are ideally used for making large purchases possible, or to generate immediate capital that could be used to start a business (set up costs and buying supplies), or in emergencies (medical, car repairs, home repairs, or an urgent purchase). And it's unwise to assume everyone else is as good with money as you. For every person that uses a loan wisely and can easily make the payments back, there are two people who can't control their spending and drown in the payments or fall into collections. Obviously this advice isn't black and white, and I'm not saying OP definitely shouldn't get a loan. Just be cautious when borrowing, especially if you don't really know the implications."

My opinion on the Pregnancy Saga.,2023-12-21 00:25:46,[deleted],KingDominoTheSecond,"I disagree. An adult should know about condoms and there is no excuse to have unprotected sex if you don't plan to have a baby. So don't justify an 18 year old not knowing any better, she's 18, she admits to knowing about her family's previous teenage pregnancies, and she does later on decide to use birth control. She even admits the reason she wasn't on birth control earlier is because she didn't want her parents to know. Well she could have bought female or male condoms to use. There's no sympathy from me. Sex is nice, I'm not going to front like I'm some type of saint, but she really should know better and I didn't see a lot of slut shaming comments, I mostly saw comments calling her stupid. Which is fair because she is stupid without a doubt. She thinks using emotions instead of logical reasoning and clearly doesn't have much foresight considering she didn't use protection and thought it'd be just fine, then happens to think that there's a random family out there that will want to bankroll her child's life. It's just an overall stupid situation."
My opinion on the Pregnancy Saga.,2023-12-21 00:25:46,[deleted],AFO1031,"I am unsure whether I agree with the sentiment the man should be held liable to the decision of the woman to continue with the pregnancy. It is a decision taken by one party that will impact both forever after.

sure, the woman‚Äôs choice is important, but is it not also important that she not deciding for only herself and what‚Äôs inside her body, but also for someone else?

are we really to belive that if student A, a middle class girl that decided it's okay since they will be able to pay for a nanny while they attend class from a bit of her parent‚Äôs money, and a bit of child support, that student B a first-generation student, buried in loans, working part-time at a store should have their life derailed for her choice? 

As detailed in the first post, it did not seem like either party was aware there even was a chance of pregnancy through pulling out. Are we really to lay the decision on solely one party on how the next of his life will turn out on the decision of somebody the man met once? Is that fair? 

There was a lack of knowledge when it came to consequence, both went in with the same notion of what the encounter was. And now the monetary, and potentially social future of one of them lay‚Äôs in the other‚Äôs hands?

My body, my choice.‚Ä¶ but also, you have to subsidize me even if I can't afford one of the choices..?

if you are approached by a girl, and she tells you she believes pulling out is safe‚Ä¶ is that truly an informed decision? Is that a fair assessment of risk? 

I only have sex with women who are on birth control, and even then only if we use a condom. The chances are:
Birth control: 0.001
Condom: 0.02
natural chance (1 in 20 tries): 0.95
and if we multiply all, we get 0.000019
aka, it would take around 526,31.58  for my partner to get pregnant 

I know the risk. But it's so ridiculous that‚Ä¶ would you even then say I ‚Äúaccepted the risk?‚Äù

My opinion on the Pregnancy Saga.,2023-12-21 00:25:46,[deleted],KingDominoTheSecond,"There is a risk in every single thing you do, such as riding on a plane, or driving your car, or walking down the stairs at night in the dark while you're tired. It all has risks. Luckily if you've been in the American education system (which isn't the best, admittedly, but it still has at least this) you've been educated about the risks of having sex, of relying on the pull out method, and the various forms of birth control.

And the difference between sex and riding in a car or plane is that sex's primary purpose is to make a child, whereas a car's primary purpose isn't to crash. You can take precautions to reduce the chance of pregnancy, but the fact of the matter is that you're doing an action that was created by evolution with the goal of making a baby. No matter what, you have to accept the fact that there's ALWAYS a risk of pregnancy. Always. 

And being uneducated doesn't negate that risk, it's the equivalent of clicking ""I accept the terms and conditions"" without reading them and not realizing what you just agreed to. And everyone knows that sex is an activity made to make kids, anyone could tell you that there's a risk involved, even if they have a skewed perception of what those risks are."

My opinion on the Pregnancy Saga.,2023-12-21 00:25:46,[deleted],AFO1031,"Everyone does know sex is to procreate yes, but as evidenced by the initial posts, and its comments, some people genuinely do believe there are perfectly safe ways to go about it, that bring no risk. Whether it's due to parents pulling kids out of sex Ed (something that happened to many people I know) or whether they attended private, or home school‚Ä¶ or even just didn't pay attention‚Ä¶ People are singing contracts without reading them first, and at the end, one party holds all the power to decide what happens with the other. Whether they‚Äôll be financially, and socially burdened for the rest of their life.

Also, I disagree with your point about comparing cars and sex. Cars are ‚Äúfor‚Äù anything. They are what they are, massive metal machines that you can get on and then control to move very quickly. Sex is a thing that gives people pleasure

Each of them are a literal or metaphorical vehicle to some goal. And they have risks that are inherent to them. Either child birth, or crashing and that entails

there is no objective goal for activities and things. We give those things and activities goals by engineering around what we want to avoid. 

A car can be used to run people over, it could also be used as a paperweight. But we have designed it so that it can be ridden on, and won't be likely to kill you. 

Likewise, we have engineered birth control, and condoms, things that make it so only one sex act in over half a million will result in somebody getting pregnant‚Ä¶ you are more likely to crash in a car than get somebody pregnant‚Ä¶

The main issue here, is that when all those protections fail, one of the two parties involved has all the power. And while they SHOULD definitely have a good part of that power, deciding whether or not to have an abortion, the fact that if they choose to birth, the other party is automatically liable for a lot of money. 

if a plane is crashing, and it has the ability to only injure those who consent, is it fair for the co-pilot to go down if he doesn't want to..? just because the pilot did?.. No, just give them both the option, and if the pilot still wants to bring the plane to a stop alongside their education, job experience, and their future prospects in love and work‚Ä¶ Then that is a choice they made"

Need Advice: Unexpected Class Cancellation cost me 16k,2023-12-20 20:35:03,Stock_Quarter_153,Clever_Mannn,Your advisor will probably let you take 2 classes that overlap. I had many friends who would show up late to one lecture because there other class overlapped by an hour.
Need Advice: Unexpected Class Cancellation cost me 16k,2023-12-20 20:35:03,Stock_Quarter_153,ImprobableGallus,"Ask a professor of one of the other sections if you can take their section despite lacking the prerequisites, and if they can let your advisor know in addition to your contacting your advisor. Sometimes, advisors respond faster to faculty than to students."
Need Advice: Unexpected Class Cancellation cost me 16k,2023-12-20 20:35:03,Stock_Quarter_153,CN-BetaReminisce,"What is your requirement left to graduate? Planning out quarters in advance is quite difficult, because of class scheduling conflict or classes getting canceled. I ran into this issue before, though mine was milder compared to your experience since I was only attempting 4 CS + 1 Breadth. 

Do you not have prerequisites fulfilled for either of the 179 sections? You might be able to convince the professor and advisor to allow enrollment in conflicting class times. Personally, I took OS Design, and the lecture component was just explaining the labs and only met every other week.

If you aren't able to do that, chances are you could probably try for part time enrollment in Spring. It should help bring tuition cost down"
Need Advice: Unexpected Class Cancellation cost me 16k,2023-12-20 20:35:03,Stock_Quarter_153,SweetandSaltyFruit,Maybe talk with your academic advisor and ask if any other class can be substituted. I had the same situation with English 103. It was never offered and instead I had to take a Creative Writing course that had two prerequisites that could not be taken concurrently‚Ä¶ luckily I changed from Holly Easley to another advisor on my last quarter. I was able to use a previous English course to fill in that requirement and I was able to graduate in Spring in time for me to apply for my masters

Details:

IGETC
The Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) is a series of courses that California community college students may complete to satisfy the lower-division breadth/general education requirements before transferring to either the California State University or most colleges and majors at UC campuses.

IGETC includes 11 courses (34 semester units) in the following subjects:

English communication
Mathematical concepts and quantitative reasoning
Arts and humanities
Social and behavioral sciences
Physical and biological sciences
Language other than English
Ethnic Studies

During high school, my school offered some courses that would give you both high school and college credits. I took culinary & biotechnology (2 years). Those gave me elective credit, accepted by UCR. 

Then, I took classes through community college as a concurrent enrollment student, and had 15 transferable credits to submit to UCR as well. 

I still take classes at CC. I have a year-long language requirement that I must satisfy, so I have been doing that through Riverside community college District. It‚Äôs much easier, and completely online (Spanish). at UCR, if you take a language course, you must attend four days a week for 50 minutes a day each time. That just didn‚Äôt make sense to me.


I encourage everyone to take whatever classes they can through community college, as it‚Äôs not only cost-effective, but also typically easier.  In order to figure out what classes you can take that are transferable, just use assist.org



This obviously goes for lower division requirements, as those are more easily accessible through community colleges. As you go further in your degree, you may not be able to find courses that are easily transferable between institutions."

Professors (at this school, considering it is pretty low ranked among other UC‚Äôs)ask wayy too much from their students. I have been in classes where professors will ask students to complete a programming assignment, lab and study for a quiz all within the same week while learning new content a week before the midterm. With the quarter system at UCR, I really dont retain all that information crammed in 10 weeks past the final and even worse, the same students trying to graduate on time are sacrificing sleep and STILL feel the need to cheat."

An update to the pregnancy saga,2023-12-20 00:02:40,Jesse4Lyfe,madkandy12,"My mom gave away my little sister for an open adoption and let me tell you, that kid is fucked up. Imagine knowing your family gave you away and you have to know them. You have to know they exist and they don‚Äôt want you. Imagine having to go visit your real family just to go back ‚Äúhome‚Äù to this house of strangers. My older sister and I are 7 and 8 years older than her so she had to come visit her fun older siblings for birthdays and holidays then had to leave. Imagine seeing your mother, the one who gave you away and didn‚Äôt want you, several times a year. Imagine seeing your happy and regular and alive family knowing they are living without you since they didn‚Äôt want you. My little sister has terrible depression, anxiety and identity issues. She feels abandoned and unwanted. She feels like a burden to everyone around her. And none of it is her fault. 

My mom made a shitty decision that has only lead to disappointment, depression and life long consequences for all of her children. She‚Äôs just setting up this poor child for a life of despair. If you can‚Äôt take care of a child, don‚Äôt have it. The trauma of adoption on a child isn‚Äôt worth ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want an abortion :( ‚Äú How you feel and the guilt you‚Äôll feel is nothing compared to ruining the life of a WHOLE person, an 80 year long consequence, bc of YOUR mistake."
An update to the pregnancy saga,2023-12-20 00:02:40,Jesse4Lyfe,candyflossy96,"It's more of an issue that she seems misinformed about what an open adoption means.

You have zero rights as a birth parent, ZERO. You are not a ""bonus parent"" or a parent at all. The child's parents/family can cut off contact with you for any reason at any time. It's their child and how much they allow you is entirely up to their discretion and judgement. 

Tyler and Catelynn Baltierra have an extensively documented outcome on the dark side of open adoption. They were manipulated by a Christian adoption service to give up their child under the guise of an open adoption, and had fantasies similar to this UCR girl. The adoptive parents severely limited contact after her first birthday, and for several years have cut off contact with Tyler and Catelynn. talk about intensely traumatic."
An update to the pregnancy saga,2023-12-20 00:02:40,Jesse4Lyfe,[deleted],"Uff. Reality doesn't hit you until the baby you bond with is wheeled out after delivery. My friend did an adoption because she's religious and she regrets it to this day. She described the above feeling as excruciating. Her body was altered forever as well and she went into a depression over it. Her identity was fashion and after the child she just can't wear what she used to without working out and dieting like crazy.

Given that perspective I really don't think doing an adoption is morally higher or remotely a solution. Whatever OP decides she'll have to live with, I just fear she may be too immature to really see the reality of carrying a child to term and how painful the delivery and giving up rights is. Whereas in an abortion you deal with your guilt, it kind of ends at you. Giving a child up for adoption involves more complicated and lifelong feelings and in this day and age the child will most likely find you and try to have a relationship whether you signed the rights over or not. Just big uff all around. Saying a prayer for this young woman"

also, I would not try to judge whether or not she‚Äôll succeed at her career during something like this‚Ä¶ It is inappropriate and unhelpful.

Again, before making a decision she should go the on site therapist and have a talk with them. They should be able to help her navigate through her feelings, choices, and if she wishes, provide her with information regarding those choices"
An update to the pregnancy saga,2023-12-20 00:02:40,Jesse4Lyfe,LeadingDefiant3361,"First off, the way you worded your post is weird. 

We‚Äôre all a family about this now.

Weirdo. 

Second of all, OP of that original post has a right to do whatever she wants with her body. No one cares if you think it‚Äôs a terrible idea. As long as she does her own research into open adoption, follows the correct steps, and sees it‚Äôs the best decision, then who are we to say it‚Äôs wrong. 
 
Third of all, the fact you made this post and others commenting it‚Äôs a bad decision to go with open adoption is concerning. Why do you care? It will affect your life in no way, shape, or form. You can disagree with her choice but it‚Äôs HER choice. There‚Äôs no reason to be upset about that commenter saying to go with open adoption. They were just offering solutions, which is what everyone on that post did. It was obvious OP of that post was having reservations, which is why they didn‚Äôt go with abortion. 

OP of that post can do whatever she wants. If it will give her a peace of mind, let her do it."
An update to the pregnancy saga,2023-12-20 00:02:40,Jesse4Lyfe,Upstairs-King-4483,"Yeah I get ur point but the thing is that if she‚Äôs choosing the open adoption route, then it‚Äôs probably likely she‚Äôs not comfortable with getting the abortion AND THAT‚ÄôS VALID. 

‚ÄúThe easiest and safest option with the lowest risk and had the chance of her succeeding was to simply abort the child‚Äù

At the end of the day she gets to choose what she wants. This is starting to read as pressuring her to get the abortion vs actually being pro choice and respecting what she wants to do with her body. Both options will suck to some degree, but you CAN‚ÄôT tell her in absolute in what her future may look like. Some women regret their abortions during their whole lives, some don‚Äôt give a fuck. Some women can‚Äôt imagine life without having their child, some can. She chose the BEST OPTION FOR HER because what she wants isn‚Äôt what YOU want. And if she‚Äôs choosing this, then it‚Äôs likely she‚Äôd be unhappier choosing the abortion. If you want to get one yourself, fine, do it, that‚Äôs your choice. But she doesn‚Äôt want to because of whatever feelings she has, and her beliefs are her own and NOT yours. You can‚Äôt project your own beliefs onto her, and neither can she to you. 

And for those questioning open adoptions, MOST adoptions in the US are open adoptions for a reason. They‚Äôre more common than closed adoptions because the pros of open adoptions outweigh its cons. There‚Äôs more healing for the birth mother, the child gets to know their ancestry and biological family, and not ‚Äúleft wondering,‚Äù and more. That‚Äôs why in the US, 95% OF INFANT ADOPTIONS ARE OPEN ADOPTIONS. And infants gets adopted pretty fast, I think you guys are thinking of older children in foster care that don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs around 2 million couples that are waiting to adopt a baby. One reason they want to is bc of infertility. That‚Äôs more common than you think, especially since more people are waiting to have kids and then menopause hits and well shit it looks like you can‚Äôt have kids. 

I don‚Äôt care. downvote me to hell, but you guys should accept that there are more options that can WORK for her than you think. There‚Äôs semi-open adoptions that can work for her as well. Giving her these options is the the WHOLE point in being pro-choice 

And also, you can become a doctor and be a mom. This is coming from someone who is also premed and getting ready to apply. I‚Äôve seen countless non-traditional and traditional applicants who are moms. Many of us don‚Äôt even apply right after graduation. The average age is 24 to matriculate in. Everyone does things on their own time. If she has the perseverance to get through something as scary as this, then I believe she will grow into a fine woman who can get through medical school and become a doctor. You can‚Äôt put limits on people you barely know."

An update to the pregnancy saga,2023-12-20 00:02:40,Jesse4Lyfe,SweetandSaltyFruit,The wording on this is so problematic. There's nothing horrific about being a teen/young mom. It's not ideal but it could work for her. I'm pro-choice but abortion shouldn't be encouraged.

An update to the pregnancy saga,2023-12-20 00:02:40,Jesse4Lyfe,AmbitiousConcert1832,And her family is going to let her give the baby up for adoption when teen pregnancy runs in her family? I doubt it. And they‚Äôre religious so they‚Äôll probably use that against her.
An update to the pregnancy saga,2023-12-20 00:02:40,Jesse4Lyfe,eloise_reads,"As a kid whose parents were both teens, I don't think it's the end of the world if she has the baby. Yes, school will be extremely difficult and she may need to take a leave from school, and that leave may last a few years. But UCR is always going to be there! She can reapply in a few years if she really needs to take the time off financially to support her child. I understand the concern of everyone posting, and I was was agreeing with the people suggesting abortion, but at this point y'all are getting to the point of insensitive and cruel. Having a baby is not the end of the world! She just needs to make sure she knows the consequences of keeping the baby (and I agree that open adoption would not be the best decision). She is going to need to work 100x times as hard to support herself and her baby, but the love she gives her child is what will matter in the end. 

My mom was 15 and my dad 17. They were separated by the time I was in kindergarten but I got a lot of love from both of them, especially my mom. She worked super hard to support me and it took her 10 years to get her A.A. from community college because she was working and doing night classes when she could. But when you have the drive and the love, you can do anything. For OP, It sounded like her family loves her, and yes they may be religious, but once they see her baby I'm sure they're going to love it like their own. (This is me being optimistic since y'all are debby downers)

My point is, she is choosing to have the baby, it is her decision, her body, and you guys need to respect that. I'm pro-choice, and she made her choice. Y'all need to back off with the insensitive comments. I understand the concern, but we just need to support her. Because if she can get into UCR with hard work, she can support herself and figure out what she needs to next. 

(And yes, I am first-gen UCR alumni, and I'm currently pursuing my master's at UCLA... all because my ""dumb"" young mom made the ""dumb"" decision to keep me. My mom is now an entrepreneur and owns her own small business! Things are still hard, but she always make me proud by how hard she works to support me)"

People certainly do care, as others have echoed my sentiments. We've personally seen the same situation play out time and time again and it always ends up the same. We're trying to save this young girl from the generational curse that has plagued so many of our own families. 

Again, I care because I can see my cousin making that post. I can see my friend's sister making that post. Yeah it doesn't affect me one way or the other you're right, but it sucks knowing the outcome and seeing a person walk down that path when there is currently a way to stop walking down that path. Once she walks down far enough though there is no coming back. 

It is upsetting seeing a person make a foolish choice, in the same way I'm sure my post upset you. You felt the need to comment because my post resonated with you, albeit negatively. Well the girl's post raised serious alarm bells in my head.

When did I say she couldn't do whatever she wants? She can do whatever she wants, and I can also say she's making stupid choices.

I'll ask the same of you. Why do you care? My post doesn't affect your life in any way, shape, or form."

Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,boyyoustupid,"tbh if you are willing to go through the steps to transfer then do it. only a few are able to navigate transferring from UC to UC. there is no seperate system built for us like CCs cuz we are already at a great 4 year institution. counselors won‚Äôt help you much. even the other UC counselors do not help or say do not call in or email (i experienced that). plus when you transfer, not all your classes go through or u have more requirements at the school you transfer to that you didn‚Äôt have to take at UCR. i had friends who had to take up an extra year or quarters because not everything transfers over. also you have to make new friends and a network. it depends on your major obviously but it is super hard to make new friends as a transfer. if CC kids kind of struggle, then imagine us. if you want to do it, then do it. there is no harm in trying but the process is not easy at all. i think that is half of the reason why the percentage of UC to UC transfer is so low because people give up half way through with the process and with that the number of applicants are really really small. the ones who do are the one who thugged it out lol. experience UCR first, join clubs, and meet new people. the things you see and experience in your first year usually do not happen again. so take advantage and work on transferring alongside it. trust me i love ucr and i dont want to transfer cuz of the ppl. keep an open mind and try ur best. good luck!"

Also does transferring to UCLA easier since I‚Äôm in UCR?

No in fact it makes it way harder. UC to UC transfers are the LAST priority. 

I don't get why there are so many of you who don't want to come here but still enroll here in hopes of transferring out. Like that makes me want to say non pc words with how dumb that is.

As a tax payer it kinda pisses me off too because you could've saved so much money just going to cc and that would've been better for everyone"
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,[deleted],"There are a few things you need to do. Look on assist.org for your desired major, plug in the UC‚Äôs you want to go to, plug in a random community college and evaluate the prerequisites you need to take. These courses must be finished by spring of soph year, and vary between UC‚Äôs. You will then need to consider the courses that UCR offers that are equivalent to the prerequisites required by  the UC‚Äôs. For example, if Calculus 1 and 2 are required, you will need to complete the Calc 9 series. To be eligible for junior level transfer, you will need to complete 90 quarter units before spring quarter of your sophomore year. You should search up ¬´¬†UC TRANSFER BY MAJOR¬†¬ª to get an idea of the average GPA for students admitted into the major you want to study at the schools you want to go to. Aim to be within this range/average GPA provided to you by this website. Apply the fall quarter of your sophomore year. Good luck. And no, transferring to UCLA will not be easier because you go to UCR. UCLA is a selective school. Don‚Äôt let people discourage you from transferring if you feel like you could do better. People have their reasons for attending UCR instead of a CC and similarly have their reasons for transferring."
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,GullibleActuary1229,"Transferring to UCSD or UCI is doable, if you‚Äôre smart and can time manage. Transferring to UCLA is hard as fuck (coming from someone who has a friend that went UCR -> UCLA). No social life, you NEED to get good grades, failing any class or getting C/D could cost you the chance of transferring (from what I heard). TBH, see how UCR is, if you realize you can‚Äôt live with UCR, aim for UCSD or UCI which actually have decent odds."
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,[deleted],"This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that applications coming from a 4 year are placed at a lower pedestal relative to CCC students. There are just fewer applications sent by 4 year college students because people tend to stay at the college they go to. It doesn‚Äôt make it easier, but I don‚Äôt think it will make it harder either."

""At UC, junior-level transfers from California community colleges are our highest priority""

https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/preparing-to-transfer/other-types-of-transfers.html#:\~:text=At%20UC%2C%20junior%2Dlevel%20transfers,some%20additional%20guidance%20for%20you"
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,[deleted],Clearly you‚Äôre not a mathematician bases on your other comments. You‚Äôre just bitter and discourage people from transferring between UC‚Äôs for some reason.
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,[deleted],"Yes, there are more applications, hence why they make up a greater majority of the admitted students. Other UC campus students seem to have a 17% chance of getting admitted relative to CCC students who have a 27% chance. CSU‚Äôs and other 4 year universities have an even lower chance, in the single digits. So no, they are not the ¬´¬†last priority¬†¬ª. UC transfers only have a 10% admit difference relative to CCC and that doesn‚Äôt account for the fact that the UC curriculum is more rigorous, so students generally get a lower GPA relative to easy CC classes. It MAY hurt your chances, i guess, but not by a substantial amount."
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,[deleted],"I didn't go here. I went to another UC for undergrad so obviously I obv am not telling people to stay here. I don't like UCR in fact. I would be more than happy if everyone transferred out. It's just malpractice to encourage people to stay here and pay full tuition to have a lower shot of transferring. I think that's so stupid and it's honestly not viable for most people. 

I think people SHOULD transfer by dropping out and going to a CC and doing it that way."
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,[deleted],"They are last priority. It goes freshman admit, cc transfer, and then others. ""At UC, junior-level transfers from California community colleges are our highest priority""

https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/preparing-to-transfer/other-types-of-transfers.html#:\~:text=At%20UC%2C%20junior%2Dlevel%20transfers,some%20additional%20guidance%20for%20you."
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,[deleted],"The thing is, if you want to transfer to an impact major, sometimes its safer to just go to a 4 year to insure you‚Äôll leave with a degree and take your chances with other colleges during your 2nd year. Dropping out to go to a CC, only to get rejected from target schools bc you‚Äôre applying to an impacted major is risky and stupid. TAG doesn‚Äôt exist anymore for a lot of majors, especially the ones that have a decent ROI. UCR is one of the few schools that still TAG‚Äôs for Computer Sci related majors, so you‚Äôd end up here anyway, and would miss out on the 4 yr college experience you might‚Äôve had for free through aid or scholarships."
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,[deleted],"Transfer admits are treated differently from freshman admits. Hence the different application process, different essay prompts, TAG, and UC GPA calculation/consideration vs regular college GPA and prerequisite completion. You are also grouping all 4 year colleges as one rather than UC‚Äôs separate from other schools. And no, you don‚Äôt need to prove your major isn‚Äôt offered. You‚Äôre spreading misinfo."
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,[deleted],"I mean if you're a UCLA/UCSD/UCB quality student you'd do well in CC and you'd for sure at least get in to a 4 year. If you're that type of quality student I really see no risk in going to a CC.  PERSONALLY I would rather go to CC than UCR so it's hard for me to see your perspective. Because going here would already be a loss for me in my book so going to a cc is kinda like nothing to lose but obv that's not true for everyone. Anyway, I'm not against transferring. I just don't think UCR is even worth staying a second year"
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,[deleted],">""At UC, junior-level transfers from California community colleges are our highest priority""

so that's a fact. and you do need to provide proof the new institution has something yours doesn't in the personal statement. I'm not trying to convince you, spend even an hour googling. There are former admissions folks that have talked about this. Good luck with your app"
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,[deleted],"Yes, we already established that they take more CCC students that UC students. You don‚Äôt need to prove or suggest that the new UC has anything to offer that your old UC doesn‚Äôt. It would be good to touch on it, but refer to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferStudents/comments/o6gj78/comment/h2t92j9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) comment that comes from actual transfer students. Yes, n=1, but that anecdote along with other people saying the same thing, and the UC website saying nothing like ¬´¬†Please tell us what your UC is missing that others have¬†to better your chances¬†¬ª suggests that what you‚Äôre saying isn‚Äôt a thing. And thanks, i guess we‚Äôll see whos right. I don‚Äôt want OP to be discouraged from transferring because they might actually have a chance according to UC website and anecdotes"
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,[deleted],"I'm not against transferring, I'm against staying at UCR and paying full tuition just for lower odds. That's stupid."
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,[deleted],What I said about impacted majors still applies. Why gamble with your future (when you can afford it) when you can take lower odds at transferring while still being guaranteed a UC education in a decent major?
Transfer,2023-12-19 23:32:07,ClassCommercial5136,[deleted],">Why gamble with your future 

Again, coming here is already a loss imo so i see dropping out to go to a CC a no lose situation. It's dirt easy to transfer here anyway so either you do well enough to go somewhere better or just come back here or somewhere comparable like cal poly or sdsu"

Course Suggestions for BCOE Ethnicity Breadth,2023-12-19 13:17:29,Botronic_Reddit,DeerAdministrative82,I agree! The readings and lessons were pretty amazing information. Especially as a Mexican American I 100% learned things I was not aware of and probably would have never known about had I not taken this class. I would basically call my dad after every lecture and talk to him about it because he‚Äôs very into Mexican politics so that was fun. But‚Ä¶ the amount of reading and writings we had to do as well as the amount of prompt questions given to us on topics that the professor had never touched upon was so draining.

When I took it for example at another school we covered more than the 9C syllabus and had hw due every day (on paper).

Math PhD Funding,2023-12-18 22:55:18,BinaryOperation,eamonnkeogh,"Hello, CS prof here.

I do know that \*some\* CS programs in the US will waive the  application fee for domestic students, if you ask. I don't know about math programs (but, it would cost nothing to ask).

The don't charge that fee to make money. They charge it as a filter (otherwise they would get thousands of applications they would need to process).

\---

If you get an offer from any grad dept, it will come with some financial package, something like ""we guarantee two years of funding, from a mix of TA-ships and RA-ships"". It is assumed that after that support has expired, you will have found a prof to fund your research. 

The funding that the profs have depends a lot on their area. If their work is applied, they may have funding, but if they are doing more esoteric work, they may have little funding, and you will have to TA forever..."
