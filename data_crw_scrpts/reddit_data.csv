Guys is Math10b rlly hard,2023-12-30 21:00:57,Purple_wisdom_,,
,,,HarkerBarker,Depends on who you have. I actually did much better in 10B than 10A. Just study and try to really understand the material because what you learn in week 1 will be important for the entire quarter.
,,,sakiamane,I haven’t taken it yet but from my friends I’ve heard that 10B is way harder than 10A.
,,,InfernicBoss,10b was way worse for me and my friends i cant lie. couldve just been the professor i guess though
,,,Mousefire777,"Been a while since I took it, but I don’t recall it being that much worse than 10A. You have to know vectors well from 10A, and the more comfortable you are with single variable integrals, the easier learning multi variable integrals will be"
,,,AcquiescentAxolotl,"Had it with Qi Zhang. Legit the hardest math class I’ve had as an ME major. Managed to get an A bc the TA (Sean Wakasa) was very helpful. Like other ppl have said, highly dependent on your professor but if you have Sean you’re chillin"
,,,Horror-Ad2573,10b ain’t hard but you’ll have to study and try getting a good TA
,,,NaveenRavindar,Highly depends on the professor. 10B was the easiest math class I have ever had and it was super easy to grasp all of the material due to the professor. That same quarter another 10B class struggled because the professor was terrible. The material itself is relatively straightforward and can be a bit tedious at times but I don’t believe the material is harder than 10A. 10B uses 9C and 10A and can be pretty intuitive if you visualize what is going on (Geogebra is your best friend). Review matrices/matrix math and you should be fine.
,,,Competitive_Oil6065,10b was way easier for me than 10a

Transfer from uc to community college,2023-12-30 12:34:58,Ok-External-,,
,,,antwan_benjamin,"Its more or less the same process as transferring from CC to UCR. Apply to your new school as a transfer student, send your transcripts through parchment. The new school will review it and give you credit for the classes that transfer. Double-check with assist.org to make sure they get it right.  

Financial aid doesn't ""transfer"" you apply for financial aid through your new school and you get a different award."
antwan_benjamin,,,Snootch74,"Commenting just to second this, because none of the other comments on this post are helpful to OP’s question, but this comment covers everything OP asked."
,,,mechasmadness,Use assist.org to see what classes have UCR equivalencies to your CC

[deleted],,,Ok-External-,I am a full time at ucr and financial aid cover me completely I actually get more reimbursement than the cost of tuition but I want to know if financial aid cover for cc tuition completely
Ok-External-,,,Odd_Bandicoot_4312,"Probably, I wouldn’t know because it’s different everywhere. You should contact the CC and ask how much they charge per unit, etc…"
Odd_Bandicoot_4312,,,Ok-External-,Okay thank u
,,,Longjumping-Air-2758,"as someone who withdrawn from UCR to a CC this fall 2023, you’d have to add the new school to ur FAFSA form to get award for that school. my CC tuition was covered fully by aid but that could depends on the school. 

but to withdraw from UCR full term, make sure you look at the deadline, which is usually the last day of instructions of fall quarter. now this is kinda complicated if u want to transfer ur credits from UCR TO CC because the deadline doesn’t let you take your finals since finals week happens after the last day of instruction. (so i basically withdrawn with no credit😭 but it is what it is and i had fun while being there so ig that makes up for it LMAO). most importantly, talk to financial aid bc you might get penalized and owe money to your aid. (in this case, i didn’t owe anything) but make sure to talk with your FA counselor.

if you’re a first year living in the dorm, definitely talk to housing because there’s contract cancellation fee and penalty rent."
Longjumping-Air-2758,,,Ok-External-,No I just finished my first year. And I rent my own house but it’s just the ucr classes schedules r so hard to get to match w my life and cc have more flexible schedule so I’m thinking about it. It just not sure if that’s even worth it. One I don’t want to have to pay back money. And also I get my tuition covered at ucr. Thanks for the info tho I’m considering it

Why are the dorms closed?,2023-12-28 23:37:01,zlickk,,
,,,DHTGK,"One reason is probably a lack of food. It'd probably be a legal nightmare to close all the dining places, but keep students in the dorms. Who can't cook due to a lack of kitchen, and likely rely on eating out.

The counterargument would probably just be to keep dining options open, but I'm pretty sure there'd be a low amount of workers to even keep one dining hall going. Most people would head home for winter break."
,,,Efficient-Put9162,"quarter starts on the 3rd but that’s for administrative staff and profs to get things in order, first day of instruction for students is the 8th, so dorms open on 7th which i agree is kinda dumb to only let us have 1 day to settle in for classes"
Efficient-Put9162,,,HoneyBunny0-0,Well dinning hall won’t be open and dorm doesn’t have kitchen (minus pentland but imagine the entire building trying to use 1 stove). Also most freshman doesn’t have a car/transportation or money to get food everyday. And the most important thing is that your housing contract starts on the 7th. U can stay during the break but im pretty sure there’s a day-rate which is like $65 per day or something. Definitely not worth it

,,,GullibleActuary1229,"I did the same as you with slightly better stats, applied as CS. However, I had some friends around the same stats as u and they applied for cs but got accepted as a bus major, as long as you know you want to switch to CS start taking the prereqs to switch majors right away in first year and you’ll be just fine"
GullibleActuary1229,,,AssistanceOne4564,What’s a bus major?
AssistanceOne4564,,,GullibleActuary1229,"Sorry a business major. With your stats you’ll most likely get accepted, but you’ll probably be accepted in as a different major (this happened to like 2 friends of mine) but as long as you know u want to switch majors the process is pretty easy"
GullibleActuary1229,,,GullibleActuary1229,"Just make sure u get in, then once u get in you can try requesting to switch majors off the bat, (but depending on your accepted major it might get denied) then just switch majors your first year"
GullibleActuary1229,,,AssistanceOne4564,What if I don’t have business as my alternate major? Will this still happen?
AssistanceOne4564,,,GullibleActuary1229,"Doesn’t need to be business, just once you get in, look into the prereqs to transfer from your majors college to BCOE, which is the engineering college. As long as you aren’t an art major or something, the process is pretty simple. Just gotta complete a bunch of clssses and get I think a 3.0 in all the classes. The classes aren’t incredibly difficult so it shouldn’t be hard to get a 3.0. But you have to complete all prereqs within your first year, BCOE doesn’t allow major transfers in after first year."
GullibleActuary1229,,,AssistanceOne4564,Okok also I’ve heard a few people say that ucr offers people open majors what does that mean if Yk what that is
AssistanceOne4564,,,GullibleActuary1229,"Same thing that I said earlier about the business major, if you’re not qualified enough for the impacted major you applied for, but you’re qualified to get in, then they’ll accept you with a different major than you applied with. Open majors are pretty much majors that aren’t impacted and ones that the school can add people too without setting off the balance, such as business"
GullibleActuary1229,,,AssistanceOne4564,Okay let’s say that they don’t let me in as a data sci or cs major right but they say that I’m qualified to get in ucr they’ll pick a random major for me does that sound right?
AssistanceOne4564,,,GullibleActuary1229,"Yea about right, not random but a less impacted major. Also looking at your stats you’ll at least get waitlisted, so you’re most likely to get in. As long as you get into the school the major switch is doable as long as u know what to do from the start"
GullibleActuary1229,,,AssistanceOne4564,Hmm okok
,,,[deleted],you'll get accepted they might change your major until you pass prereqs but should be good
[deleted],,,AssistanceOne4564,Wdm change my major? Like completely or will be it be automatically changed to cs after I have my classes
AssistanceOne4564,,,[deleted],You'll prob get let in as your second major and they'll give you a plan to switch into your first major once you pass the prereqs
,,,lpurgsl,"With those stats prolly no, but it’s not the end!! My situation was I knew I wanted CS but I didn’t have the stats and got in with my backup as a math major. I did the transition in to CS after making the requirements for the transfer my sophomore year."
lpurgsl,,,AssistanceOne4564,What if I had my other Major as data sci?
AssistanceOne4564,,,lpurgsl,"Data sci is a new major at UCR, idk what school it’s in but I think it’s in BCOE which means if your sure u want to switch (because who knows maybe you’ll like data sci) it’ll be easier to switch than I was for me because math is in CNAS. Idk the stats for data sci since again it’s relatively new, but I hope you get in!"
lpurgsl,,,AssistanceOne4564,Okok thank you
,,,mechasmadness,Have a backup major in BCOE/CNAS to be safe
mechasmadness,,,AssistanceOne4564,My backup was data sci. Is that any better for my situation
AssistanceOne4564,,,mechasmadness,It’s a newer major so maybe? You take a lot of the same intro classes iirc
AssistanceOne4564,,,GullibleActuary1229,"Mmm it’ll be about the same, data sci is pretty impacted as well."
,,,ChekerUp,"I had a similar gpa with less extracurriculars, but at the time applied for business. UCR's major switch process is so easy especially as a freshman so by my 2nd quarter I was already taking cs classes and in my 3rd quarter of my first year I succesfully switched to CS. So if you get in with your alternate major switching is almost guaranteed."
,,,Critical_Judge_3625,Idk
,,,KingDominoTheSecond,what is a reach school?
KingDominoTheSecond,,,LeiaPrincess2942,A Reach school is a school where you have a lower chance of admission vs. a Target or Safety school.

KingDominoTheSecond,,,Good_Landscape226,Research I’m pretty sure they meant
Good_Landscape226,,,KingDominoTheSecond,"oh thank you, I probably should have been able to tell that for myself"
,,,[deleted],"Yes there's a clarification I want to make though. Major choice has no impact on admission, just what major you're admitted under 

OP will most likely get in, he has the stats for getting in here. He most likely won't get in with cs, those are the figures you're stating. He'll most likely get his second choice major and can later do well in prereqs to switch."
[deleted],,,LeiaPrincess2942,"UCR does admit by major and will consider the alternate major and actually sometimes will offer applicants open majors that were not listed on their application so major choice does impact admission.  For OP as a CS major, yes it will be a tough admit but they do not list an alternate major so that is why I asked."

ManWhoLovesGaming,,,KingDominoTheSecond,what is the pay like? is it hourly or salary or commission? looking for a side hustle
,,,Hot-Afternoon-4831,I graduated a year ago with a degree in CS. I had a Mac and I had to lend a windows machine from loan2learn to run a flavor of Ubuntu for our cyber security classes. It’s also like Linux is the go to for CS (windows isn’t far off with WSL)
Hot-Afternoon-4831,,,KingDominoTheSecond,"So in CompSci, Linux is basically required, good to know. Do you know how the general workflow is for non-compsci classes?"
KingDominoTheSecond,,,Hot-Afternoon-4831,I knew plenty of non cs friends who got by using a basic windows or a MacBook. Linux is a little odd especially for someone not in CS but you should be okay! Worst case you can borrow a windows machine from loan2learn (they have decent thinkpads) or run a VM or dual boot
KingDominoTheSecond,,,epic4evr11,Windows user in CS here. Not required by any means but a good amount of WSL and ssh to school servers. For sure a super Linux-friendly program
,,,Indische_Legion,"You’ll be fine with Linux unless you intend on taking classes that require specific programs, like solidworks, photoshop etc that don’t work on Linux or are very buggy with workarounds

I personally run windows 11 with wsl2, CS stuff almost exclusively on wsl, and windows for general use/stability

I used to run Linux full time but found it not worth the hassle, and wsl fills that gap nicely"
Indische_Legion,,,Indische_Legion,Also delete Linux cos it makes you look like a virgin stem kid 👍
Indische_Legion,,,KingDominoTheSecond,"I can't just delete Linux, I need to have something to do homework on"

,,,Happy-Suggestion-892,"arch gang! i’m a cs student and use macOs as my main productivity OS. windows is for chilling and gaming. i’ve messed around with arch but unless your used to linux, i would not advise it. go with ubuntu or debian instead. you could also do a hack n tosh but that could be a bitch to set up unless u do research before buying a compatible laptop. don’t forget mac is unix based and you can even change from zsh to bash rlly easily."
Happy-Suggestion-892,,,KingDominoTheSecond,"I wouldn't ever want to use MacOS just because I find that it doesn't work well for me, especially because I'm not in the Apple ecosystem at all, and the primary appeal of MacOS is it's tight integration with other Apple products. Since I don't own any apple products it's a hard sell for me. I am just using Arch because the distro that I'm running is built on Arch, but it shouldn't be too big of a problem for me, since I have experience with KDE's applications. I've already tried out Ubuntu, Kubuntu, and Mint, so if I need to I will fall back on those since they're all debian/ubuntu based. Since I'm not a CS major or taking any CS classes I don't expect to have any inherent advantages from using Linux for my classes, it just happens to be what I'm using and I want to ensure that all goes well and that there aren't any weird UCR applications that only work on Windows and Mac, like lockdown test browsers."
,,,raptor8134,"Yeah I did my first quarter with arch and a tiling wm just fine, definitely keep a windows dual boot around tho for solidworks and shit (because I know you're in engineering too)"
,,,JuiceBoxcks,Can u run a virtual machine with windows?
JuiceBoxcks,,,KingDominoTheSecond,"Yeah I could but that kinda sucks and I'd rather not. It can be kind of buggy at times and performance isn't the best. I use Linux because it's free and a lot less resource heavy on my computer, so emulating windows would be really inefficient for me."
KingDominoTheSecond,,,Jodaco,"If you have a class that requires you to do an online test in a lockdown browser, you might have an issue. In general you shouldn’t have an issue, but if you did, you could probably rent a laptop from loan2learn for a couple hours. 

Linux isn’t required for CS, typically assignments are run on a server over ssh or use VMs which can be run from anywhere."
,,,snappyapple632,I'm curious about this as well. I'm an electrical engineering student who's been using Zorin OS as my daily driver since last year. I still have Windows as a second boot option for the 1% of stuff that doesn't work on Linux no matter what.
,,,WindblownSquash,If youre committed sure but there are classes in which it is hard. If your class requires ssh it will be no problem. Most of the stuff is done from the schools servers anyway.

How hard is CS10C?,2023-12-27 05:23:25,night-gale,,
,,,IllamanatiConfirmed,"10C is harder than 10B imo, but it wasn’t too bad for me. Code quality plays a bigger role in general- comments, rule of three, avoiding memory leaks, etc. At least for Patrick Miller, the practice midterms and finals were very helpful."
,,,DreamersDeal,"This class, Data Structures and Algorithms, teaches you the intro material for leetcode. 

if you're planning to intern somewhere computer science related, pay attention. this class gives you tools to pass those interviews. 

in terms of difficulty, I'd say it's harder than earlier cs classes as it builds on top of those but most of the concepts learned are rather easy to understand, but coding those concepts may be different. 

good luck, you'll do great !"

I 100 percent peaked in college and I’m struggling :(,2023-12-27 00:01:37,Luigi-The-Weenie,,
,,,Emergency_Banana_779,"i think you probably just need a change of pace, go out and do something, explore, travel, idk. You seem pretty settled, maybe explore a little bit and do stuff outside your comfort zone, whether it be career, romance, etc, etc"
,,,gessekaii,"Hey! I’m an alumni too and I know exactly how you feel. What I think it is that you don’t have the busy and tight schedule that school gave you and it’s hitting hard. 

I know you mentioned about not going to grad school, but as someone who chose to go get my Master’s degree it has tremendously changed my life for the better. I got my BA in English, so jobs I was looking was limiting. Once I got accepted into a Master’s program, I was able to connect with people who are in the same field as me and work with professors who are very helpful and has given me connections in my field. I was able to teach my first university class, which now makes my resume look better and gave me more experience. 

What people don’t seem to mention is that grad school helps a lot with getting better job connections and overall, you’ll come out of it much more knowledgeable. My experience at grad school has been positive, and much more laid back than getting a Bachelor’s. I got a full-ride financial aid to cover the cost of grad school, so for me it’s been worth it. You should defiantly check out some schools and ask Fafsa about the costs. You also don’t need to go a UC for grad school. A lot of people I know decided to go from UC to Cal-State just to earn their Master’s. 

At the end, it’s your personal choice if you want to go back to school. It’s some things to consider and what I can share as someone who decided going back to school was the best thing for me after graduating from UCR."
,,,RevelryByNight,"There's not a man alive that truly peaked at 24.   


Keep learning and growing, my friend."
,,,HaikusfromBuddha,"Graduated I think 2020 when Covid happened. Didn’t get to walk the stage because of it. Didn’t have the best gpa. With this in mind I joined some clubs and jobs that would be relevant to my field CS.

It was enough to differentiate myself and I was able to land a good job. I bought a home earlier this year(How? In the IE that’s how) and I think I can pay it off in two years if I just keep my expenses low and stay at my parents house every other day.

I think the best move financially, if your mental health isn’t in jeopardy at your parents home, is to stay there.

Save up as much as you can.

I don’t have many hobbies besides video games. So my days just consist of work and trying to build up the furniture in my house.

Have I peaked? I don’t think so. I never thought I’d be in the position I am now so I’m setting new goals. 

After my house is paid off I’ll try saving up for a crazy car.

I think the only thing that would put a wrench in my life/lifestyle is if I find a significant other. I’m not really focused on that. 

Most of my life was spent taking care of siblings so I kind of want a couple of years of just me time. Being a lazy Mfker. Wake up late during the weekends. Watch TikTok ungodly hours.

Idk maybe some people frown upon that but it makes me happy.


As for OP. Do you currently have a job in your major? 20k seems awfully low. My job search pretty much showed me GPA doesn’t matter. Experience and people who you know matter. I’m not sure if a graduate degree is worth it unless you know for a fact you can’t get a job without it.

I had friends much smarter than me, much better gpas, some with Masters Degrees struggle to get jobs after graduation.

I think it’s just a relentless numbers game. Apply. Don’t stop applying. Reach out to recruiters. Try to get experience in your area any way possible. I was sending out more than a hundred applications per week. I only got like 6 responses.

I swear earlier this year I received a rejection letter from some application I sent in 2020."

HaikusfromBuddha,,,Global_Awareness6783,Do you have any recommendations for the clubs and jobs related to CS?
Global_Awareness6783,,,HaikusfromBuddha,"Go to any club and pitch a CS project you want to do for them. 

The gamespawn club didn’t have a website so I asked them if I could be their web admin. Made a couple of sites for their events. I tried working on a esports stats app that I never finished for them. It was a cool portfolio project.

I saw some guy create a login c++ app for a club where they just needed to swipe their student Id and the basic terminal c++ program logged them in attendance.

Just pitch something to any club you’re interested in. Maybe do it with friends so you guys could release a viable project that can be mainted by future students.

For jobs you can reach out to the career center. There was a part time job I got their called dreams for schools. Basically teach basic visual programming to elementary students near UCR."

,,,rjvalenz,"I hear you and don't worry about peaks in your life. I do hope and wish you enjoy the ""process"" of growing, developing, and doing what is meaningful for you. Explore! The world is vast no matter where you're at.   


My story - I graduated from UCR a little over a decade ago and while there, I was part of Greek life, sociological research and eventually traveling and moving abroad to Spain and Italy to do research. That led to my food and wine-tasting career for about \~2 years in Italy. I fell out of love with that career and broke up with my partner to move back and try to start a career in San Francisco. Then starting my career in tech - and ironically that was when like you, I felt a feeling of losing my peak because I went from being that big fish in a small pond, to entering the grand ocean where everyone was brilliant. You kind of get stuck in a role while working in tech/startups and I felt burnt out. Eventually started a nonprofit tech and sold that off, came back to work at a couple more startups and big-name tech companies. And here I am now, part of big tech layoffs last year to spend time away from it to heal from corporate toxicity, terrible office politics, and capitalism exploiting us. It's been nice to do creative endeavors like officiating weddings around the world, woodworking, sneaker making, and really spending meaningful time with people who matter to me.   


Advice to you: it's ok to feel the way you do. Life comes in waves, you'll have your highs and lows, and there will be lulls and higher peaks than before. The beauty is that no matter what point you're at, you'll have perspective. With that perspective, I hope you learn to accept the privileges that come with circumstances so that you discover new paths and opportunities (I grew up as an immigrant and low-income kid - so it's insane to me that I was ever given a shot to build my life to where it's at now by using tech space as a stepping stone). I understand that money, title, and status can impact your perspective - but I hope you rewire that thinking of success into something that's more catered to you. Do what is meaningful, let the money and status be an afterthought, and always stay curious even in the most toxic circumstances."
,,,Hot-Afternoon-4831,"Well I peaked post college, graduated a year ago to landing a six figure job that put me in the highest tax bracket. The “peaked” was a lie cause everyone’s life is different and you need to advocate a new way of looking at life. Life is a journey, there will be so many ups and downs. Nothings lost yet, you already great at recognizing what’s going wrong (not everyone has the balls to admit it), it’s time to do something about it. 

And about your plans for 2024, I don’t wanna indulge in your personal but if I were I probably wouldn’t move in with a partner that makes me feel bad for making significantly less. I’m not saying anything bad about your partner, but it stings like a bee knowing you’re no where close to making at least half of what they make. Just my 0.02

Oh and about me, I’m still cooking up something that would put me one step closer to where I wanna be in life, I plan on peaking all my life and improving myself every year :)"

PhD students of UCR: What do finances look like?,2023-12-26 18:11:42,CADBeast,,
,,,Academic_Afternoon41,"Math PhD here. They pay me about $2800 a month. That's partly for TAship (up to 20 hours a week) and partly from a stipend. Tuition and health insurance are both covered as well. You get paid over breaks too. Some grads do extra teaching over Summer to make additional income. My rent (split with 1 other person) is $1850 for a 1-bedroom apartment walking distance from campus. Wasn't able to get housing on campus so not sure how much; can probably find on website. Don't need extra loans; in fact, am paying off my previous loans atm."
Academic_Afternoon41,,,CADBeast,Thanks for the insight! Much appreciated.
,,,eamonnkeogh,"You need to tell us your major.

Most people in engineering/ computer science make enough from RA-ships (and summer internships) to not need any loans. They can afford a cheap car etc."
eamonnkeogh,,,CADBeast,"Stipend offer for the first year is about 41k (3 quarters + summer, includes TAship earnings in my understanding). Car is fully paid and is fairly new so I don’t expect to need a new one soon. I come from a high COL area so I don’t have a good sense of how this number stacks up with Riverside COL."

,,,Jamonde,"Talk to the graduate students in the department(s) you are applying to, and ask them for specifics.

This is a question that is really a case-by-case basis. You need to ask what the typical funding packages are for graduate students in your department of interest, then you can factor this into things like rent, food costs, and other bills you will have. For example, do you have undergrad loans or car loans you need to take care of? Phone bills? Insurance? Are you supporting someone else somehow?"
,,,JJJSchmidt_etAl,"It's a little tight but if you're careful it's enough to not require any more debt. A few things:

1. You want to live in a house; apartments, from campus or otherwise, are big money sink. There's lots close to campus.
2. The pay for summer TA is pretty darn good, that will push you into the black"
,,,F_Silence,"Newly grad MSE PhD here, my salary was always enough to pay for rent/utility + gas + food, not much left after these but I can still spend some on video games.

I graduated just before the new contract earned during that major strike takes effect so likely you will earn more."
,,,Destinesia_,"The department plays a super heavy role in finances, since I believe the pay for both being a researcher or a TA are different between different departments"
,,,lyndxe,"Does the 41k/yr include your tuition and insurance reimbursements as well?  I'm curious what these stipend offers are looking like for incoming PhD students at UCR.  I've heard this vastly varies by department/funding available.  Previously, the ""general stipend"" looked very unimpressive (according to their website), equating out to just above $7k a quarter take-home salary.  Also, is that stipend guaranteed funding for the duration of your PhD?"
lyndxe,,,CADBeast,"No, the 41k/yr is the stipend (what I’ll receive pre-tax). The tuition and insurance is paid directly by the department, we don’t need to take care of it apart from just making sure it was done.

My understanding is that it’s guaranteed funding as long as you’re in good standing, but I’m not too sure. I haven’t clarified with them."
,,,Individual-Trash-171,"You’re looking at around 650-900 for a single room in an apartment or a house, with some house mates(houses are typically cheaper). A one bedroom one bathroom for just yourself would be $1600-2000 (not recommended when living on a stipend). Utilities are maybe $60 a month?? Most people do not take out additional loans and most don’t live on campus. 41k a year is a good amount if you don’t have kids or a car payment."

,,,exiting_stasis_pod,"Do you really want to be part of the military with world geopolitics as unsettled as they are? National Guard is sometimes deployed outside the US as support.

,,,AFO1031,"I would think about it a bit more. You lose quite a bit when you join the military. I would perhpahs go and check the studies that have been made on the subject 

I'm not speaking about war trauma and such, I mean what you will subject yourself to while in training… Please just take a closer look, and visit the school’s therapist. They should have more information on what the best choice for you might be"
,,,StopUsingWe,"I’d also look at Active Duty, it’s easier to do your four years and get out with your benefits. I don’t know exactly how Guard works since I was active but I think to qualify for the Post 9/11 GI Bill, you need to have 90 days of Active Duty service (pretty much deploying).
I would also strongly consider the US Air Force/Air National Guard if you really are set on the Guard as Air Force has a better quality of life.

And a tip if you do go Active, whenever you have physical issues with your body, go to the doctor so it’ll be in your records and you’ll be able to get disability pay when you get out. This is something I should have done and only once mentioned back problems to my doctor. Because of that I only get 10% disability but that is still roughly $160 a month that you get for free"

,,,Macoron,"IF you have trouble paying for tuition AND military service is something you’re open to, talk to the ROTC program on campus about the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP). This allows you to be in the National Guard as well as be enrolled in school as a full-time student. I did not do SMP, but was in ROTC on campus and received a scholarship (for which I currently fulfilling my service obligation). 

If you do instead want to drop-out and enlist, the ROTC cadre are familiar with options for this and can help guide you based on what’s best for you."
,,,adisonpooh4,"Not an very bad option for you if you can deal with all the heavier psychical training requirements by the military, and I truly hope the military can help with your tuition or financial needs. I got some friends who serve in military too, the most complaining they had was feeling lonely and leave their family by a long period of time due to overseas deployments. So stay safe and good luck of your academic journey. Oh and try to maintain a good mental health condition during your time in the military"
,,,Accomplished_King747,Just join the national guard. Same benefits and you can go to school at the same time. It's what I did.
,,,Combat_Commo,"I think that’s a good decision. I joined the military when I was 23! Was doing CC part time while working full time but didn’t like it. This was in 2000 going into the summer of 2001 right before 911 happened. 

Then 911 happened. I hated school and work and really couldn’t find myself so I decided to join during this unique time in our country’s history.

I joined the Army because I wanted to be a Paratrooper and it was not easy. I did 1 tour in Afghanistan and came back. Went through really tough times both physically and on a personal level but it makes it feel so much worth it.

I think that going to the Military is a good option. You’ll have more education benefits on top of your existing ones! Plus, if you happened to get hurt…you can get disability compensation so make sure you keep copies and a journal of your injuries.

It’ll be a good experience as long as you make the most out of it. Don’t do National Guard or Reserves, go active to get full benefits."
,,,Moses_philo_p,"If u think living alone is hard, signing a contract where u give up all your rights for years is much much worse, just go to CC they’ll spay for school and give u money for housing, the rest u can get a job, go to school, even if u fail every single class they will still give u financial aid, my opinion don’t quit school"
,,,WindblownSquash,"So your parents want you in college but would kick you out for staying in college and let you stay for leaving? 

Your logic is childish at best"
,,,AmateurCubz,"If your going national guard then you should try doing Community College at the same time, after basic you'll only be working 2 days a month and 2 weeks a year plus you won't qualify for the post 911 gi bill which is the really useful one."
,,,ongeku,"Depending on what job you sign up for in the National Guard, you can still do both guard and UCR.

I took a leave of absence from UCR for the fall quarter and went to basic and advanced training. Came back to UCR after I completed both those trainings, and just did my weekend drills and 2 week summer annual training until I graduated on time.

The only regret I had was picking a military job by training length (4 weeks of advanced training for mine). Don't do that- pick a job that you'll enjoy and perhaps has some transferability into the civilian world.

But overall, it was a great decision that set me up for the rest of college and getting into my first civilian full time role. Having the Montgomery GI bill and the GI Bill kicker ($750/mo at the time) and having priority class registration was great. My deployment right after college gave me a lot of operational experience that really set me apart for employers, being a fresh grad.

tl;dr, you don't have to drop out to do the guard or any part time military service. Work with the UCR veteran's office to make sure you get set up with a leave of absence for your initial training"

keonmi,,,Then-Cartographer695,oooh thank youu!!
,,,instantramen045,"I just took 10c with Patrick Miller (great prof btw!) and got an A! Here’s my advice:

1. Start the labs and programming assignments at least 3 days before the due date. Spend day 1 getting familiar with what it’s asking for, day 2 on the code, and day 3 on edge cases and working out the kinks. Most of assignments WILL take multiple hours, so don’t torture yourself by trying to cram it like I did for the first few assignments 💀

2. Take advantage of SI if you can! You’ll meet people who are happy to help when you get stuck (and you will, most definitely, get stuck.)

3. Miller is teaching all of the sections next quarter. I HIGHLY recommend going to his office hours, which he treats more like a mini-lecture. He’ll go over the most challenging parts of the lab/programming assignment of that week, and when the midterm and final come up he’ll even work on problems that show up word-for-word on the exams. I had a class that overlapped with his office hours that I ended up skipping pretty often because that how helpful his office hours were. 

4. Don’t be afraid to reach out to Miller directly! It might seem a bit intimidating at first, but he really enjoys helping his students. I’d also recommend reserving one-on-one office hours meet-ups before midterms and finals in advance, even if you don’t have any questions at the moment. His slots would always fill up a week before the exams this quarter, so you were out of luck if you had any last-minute questions. Better to not need a slot you reserved and cancel it then to need one and not have any available. 

5. Although you do a lot of programming in this class, the core of it are the abstract data concepts. Understanding those concepts is more important than writing perfect code, especially on the exams, where he is very liberal with partial credit. Even if your answer is totally wrong, explaining the concept on the side will get you some points back (and with that 70% cutoff, every point counts!)

TriG__,,,[deleted],"Fine. I’ll play your game, asshole.

Kappa Sigma is not recognized by UCR at all. For that matter, they’ve actually been condemned by various guilds for their hazing practices. If Kappa Sigma is not a fraternity affiliated with UCR in any way, why should Kappa Sigma be allowed to form a de-facto political party and continue voting their own into power while maintaining a chokehold over a community they’re not even a part of? This is in fact, a dishonest act, in accordance with Cambridge’s definition of rigging. 

On another note, a fraternity who was condemned for vandalizing other organizations with hate symbols does not deserve to be defended, be their elections rigged or not.

[deleted],,,TriG__,"""A chokehold over a community their not a part of"".  
What? A: They are a part of the UCR community so I don't really understand this. B: what chokehold? You say this like they're funneling money into their own accounts or writing legislation for their own benefit. Do you actually know how ASUCR works? Kappa sigma members are a minority within ASUCR, so I find this highly unlikely to happen in the first place as everything is voted on by the whole senate. Additionally, all legislation and funding passed by ASUCR is open to the public to look at, so you can read through all of it. I guarantee you don't find a single thing of note in relation to Kappa Sigma.  
  
Just because Kappa Sigma has never been on IFC at UCR doesn't mean they're some underground band of thugs or something like you're making it out to be. UCR's Kappa Sigma chapter is actually a top ranked chapter nationally within the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Unrecognized =/= dismissed. In your citation you linked the list of dismissed and unrecognized organizations. If you actually read the page, you'll quickly realize that the dismissed organizations are the ones who have been caught in malicious activities, and thus violates school policy to join. You'll notice that Kappa Sigma falls under the unrecognized section. This simply means that they've never been on the schools IFC. Nothing more. So anything relating to that which you've mentioned is moot (I notice you didn't cite your 'condemned by various guilds'). Sadly I think I'll need to spell it out for you: 'Why should they be allowed to participate in ASUCR?' because they are UCR students and are not in any violation of any school policy by being in Kappa Sigma, nor do their members in ASUCR violate any policies which would result in their removal. This is why they are allowed to LMAO.  
  
I honestly find it hard to believe that in your comment you bring up what another Kappa Sigma chapter at another school did. Like I don't even know where to begin, that is just a complete lack of critical thinking on your part. To act like each chapter of a fraternity is at all similar from campus to campus is laughably stupid. Putting that in your argument is just so incredibly irrelevant if you're trying to talk about a specific chapter of a fraternity.  
  
If you choose to ignore everything I just said, I would implore you to direct your questions/frustrations to any of the professional faculty working with/for ASUCR. I'm positive they could quash your very misguided qualms.  
  
Also I think you should change your username haha, thanks for playing my game though, friend :)"

,,,tryingtobeadoctor234,As a girl at UCR it’s only creepy when they have no rizz. Be confident and genuine you should be fine.
tryingtobeadoctor234,,,RiverMountain662,What makes a guy have no rizz?  Why would that automatically be creepy?
RiverMountain662,,,tryingtobeadoctor234,"Lack of confidence in what they are saying or doing. To me, it gives off alternative motives. Like they’re only talking to girls to get something rather than actually interested in her. But everything is subjective."
tryingtobeadoctor234,,,RiverMountain662,"That lack of confidence could be a speech impediment, an indelible ""awkward/quirky"" personality, or a host of other reasons, not necessarily something awful.  I think the word ""creepy"" is an overused word that is unfairly directed mostly at men who do not fit a rigid, stereotypical criteria for ""cool.""  It's really dehumanizing and makes men not want to approach women altogether. 

Many of these men may lack ""confidence"" (whatever that truly means) is that what they say and do is not well received by people and they just don't feel accepted for who they are.  I appreciate your feedback."
RiverMountain662,,,tryingtobeadoctor234,"Right, subjectivity like most human interactions is here. But i think we’re saying similar things. Intentions, as long as the intentions aren’t one of pure usage or objectification on both parties sides then it’s fine. This can also apply to non heterosexual dating or flirting. Not having confidence is one things and forgivable. Approaching someone or talking to someone to only receive (sex or attention) can be crappy for all involved. Approach and talk to people you actually want to get to know and are sincere. The sincerity is attractive and sexy. In my opinion, the creepiness comes out when the person isn’t sincere or upfront about their motives. There is no “nice guying” your way into a persons pants you would just be a dick or creep (regardless of gender)."
tryingtobeadoctor234,,,RiverMountain662,"Therein lies the conundrum for men.  Since men are expected to take the initiative to approach, why would a man first approach a woman he is not physically attracted to and does not see himself having sex with?  Men cannot see into a woman's soul and gauge her personality/character without being allowed to converse with her."
RiverMountain662,,,tryingtobeadoctor234,"Well this goes into sex theory, men and women can fall into the role of pursuer and perused. Putting aside the fact that being more dominating or submissive in relationships are dependent on the individuals personal preferences, in your example the man is interacting with the woman based off of intention of getting to know them sparked by physical attraction. That is fine. The line, in my opinion, is when the man in this scenario doesn’t care about who she is only what she can do or give him. Being viewed as a full person compared to a sex object, intentions here are everything. My advice is focus on seeing someone who you like physically and going to talk to them to get to know them, not just get or expect sex from them. This leads to resentment from men towards women who they think are holding out on them for no reason other than looks or money or something trivial. There are people who are more than willing to do the hook up one night stand agreement, just be upfront and honest about it. It’s the men who want to turn every woman into that regardless of who they are or what they may want."
tryingtobeadoctor234,,,RiverMountain662,"That's fair, but even then there are several things men are expected to have just to be considered worthy, even by unattractive women.  

NSA, I have been told by even unattractive women, is only for the hot guys.  So average or unattractive guys' options to get experience  are diminished."
RiverMountain662,,,tryingtobeadoctor234,"But attractiveness is subjective. There are people with all types of preferences that don’t fit the conventional attractive features. If the woman isn’t attracted to you based solely off of looks I would think that’s a red flag in general. But if you want to be considered conventionally attractive so you’d have more options to choose from or better yet have those picky shallow women pick you because you met their standards is a losing battle.  Even if they pick you why would you value their opinion when they themselves are shallow and only good for looks or status symbols. The question here is what are you looking for and why, is it just for sex then you’ll fall into this cycle of unattainable standards to get a shallow man or woman. If you actually want a relationship it really doesn’t matter how you look because someone will find you attractive ( good hygiene goes a long way). Out of 8 Billion people there will be a couple thousand who would think your drop dead hot. We can never get self esteem boosts from others it’s short lived and unsatisfying. Confidence and love of yourself has to come from you. And that sort of confidence will translate with your flirting or talking to someone you like."
tryingtobeadoctor234,,,RiverMountain662,"I think that there has to be some level of physical attraction for a relationship to be feasible, otherwise it just is not going to work out.  For me, a woman can have the best personality, but if I am not attracted to her physical appearance, then she is going to find out and get hurt.  Just like how it is not enough for guys to be ""nice,"" it is not enough for a woman just to have a great personality.  She needs to be physically attractive is she is expecting a guy to exhaust himself to have the extra qualities she is looking for.

I think OP would like to meet the conventionally ""attractive"" women, because he just is not going to exhaust himself to meet the standards of conventionally unattractive women.  Not all unattractive women have this particular woman's mindset and delusion, but this old, haggard, unattractive woman is of the opinion that a man should exhaust himself to meet her standards.  What man is going to exhaust himself just to have sex with an ugly woman like her?

If she’s just chilling, maybe ask if she could talk for a bit or start with a question relating to something you see.

Kappa Sigma is not recognized by UCR at all. For that matter, they’ve actually been condemned by various guilds for their hazing practices. If Kappa Sigma is not a fraternity affiliated with UCR in any way, why should Kappa Sigma be allowed to form a de-facto political party and continue voting their own into power while maintaining a chokehold over a community they’re not even a part of? This is in fact, a dishonest act, in accordance with Cambridge’s definition of rigging. 

On another note, a fraternity who was condemned for vandalizing other organizations with hate symbols does not deserve to be defended, be their elections rigged or not.

[deleted],,,TriG__,"""A chokehold over a community their not a part of"".  
What? A: They are a part of the UCR community so I don't really understand this. B: what chokehold? You say this like they're funneling money into their own accounts or writing legislation for their own benefit. Do you actually know how ASUCR works? Kappa sigma members are a minority within ASUCR, so I find this highly unlikely to happen in the first place as everything is voted on by the whole senate. Additionally, all legislation and funding passed by ASUCR is open to the public to look at, so you can read through all of it. I guarantee you don't find a single thing of note in relation to Kappa Sigma.  
  
Just because Kappa Sigma has never been on IFC at UCR doesn't mean they're some underground band of thugs or something like you're making it out to be. UCR's Kappa Sigma chapter is actually a top ranked chapter nationally within the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Unrecognized =/= dismissed. In your citation you linked the list of dismissed and unrecognized organizations. If you actually read the page, you'll quickly realize that the dismissed organizations are the ones who have been caught in malicious activities, and thus violates school policy to join. You'll notice that Kappa Sigma falls under the unrecognized section. This simply means that they've never been on the schools IFC. Nothing more. So anything relating to that which you've mentioned is moot (I notice you didn't cite your 'condemned by various guilds'). Sadly I think I'll need to spell it out for you: 'Why should they be allowed to participate in ASUCR?' because they are UCR students and are not in any violation of any school policy by being in Kappa Sigma, nor do their members in ASUCR violate any policies which would result in their removal. This is why they are allowed to LMAO.  
  
I honestly find it hard to believe that in your comment you bring up what another Kappa Sigma chapter at another school did. Like I don't even know where to begin, that is just a complete lack of critical thinking on your part. To act like each chapter of a fraternity is at all similar from campus to campus is laughably stupid. Putting that in your argument is just so incredibly irrelevant if you're trying to talk about a specific chapter of a fraternity.  
  
If you choose to ignore everything I just said, I would implore you to direct your questions/frustrations to any of the professional faculty working with/for ASUCR. I'm positive they could quash your very misguided qualms.

RiverMountain662,,,tryingtobeadoctor234,"Lack of confidence in what they are saying or doing. To me, it gives off alternative motives. Like they’re only talking to girls to get something rather than actually interested in her. But everything is subjective."
tryingtobeadoctor234,,,RiverMountain662,"That lack of confidence could be a speech impediment, an indelible ""awkward/quirky"" personality, or a host of other reasons, not necessarily something awful.  I think the word ""creepy"" is an overused word that is unfairly directed mostly at men who do not fit a rigid, stereotypical criteria for ""cool.""  It's really dehumanizing and makes men not want to approach women altogether. 

Many of these men may lack ""confidence"" (whatever that truly means) is that what they say and do is not well received by people and they just don't feel accepted for who they are.  I appreciate your feedback."
RiverMountain662,,,tryingtobeadoctor234,"Right, subjectivity like most human interactions is here. But i think we’re saying similar things. Intentions, as long as the intentions aren’t one of pure usage or objectification on both parties sides then it’s fine. This can also apply to non heterosexual dating or flirting. Not having confidence is one things and forgivable. Approaching someone or talking to someone to only receive (sex or attention) can be crappy for all involved. Approach and talk to people you actually want to get to know and are sincere. The sincerity is attractive and sexy. In my opinion, the creepiness comes out when the person isn’t sincere or upfront about their motives. There is no “nice guying” your way into a persons pants you would just be a dick or creep (regardless of gender)."
tryingtobeadoctor234,,,RiverMountain662,"Therein lies the conundrum for men.  Since men are expected to take the initiative to approach, why would a man first approach a woman he is not physically attracted to and does not see himself having sex with?  Men cannot see into a woman's soul and gauge her personality/character without being allowed to converse with her."
RiverMountain662,,,tryingtobeadoctor234,"Well this goes into sex theory, men and women can fall into the role of pursuer and perused. Putting aside the fact that being more dominating or submissive in relationships are dependent on the individuals personal preferences, in your example the man is interacting with the woman based off of intention of getting to know them sparked by physical attraction. That is fine. The line, in my opinion, is when the man in this scenario doesn’t care about who she is only what she can do or give him. Being viewed as a full person compared to a sex object, intentions here are everything. My advice is focus on seeing someone who you like physically and going to talk to them to get to know them, not just get or expect sex from them. This leads to resentment from men towards women who they think are holding out on them for no reason other than looks or money or something trivial. There are people who are more than willing to do the hook up one night stand agreement, just be upfront and honest about it. It’s the men who want to turn every woman into that regardless of who they are or what they may want."
tryingtobeadoctor234,,,RiverMountain662,"That's fair, but even then there are several things men are expected to have just to be considered worthy, even by unattractive women.  

NSA, I have been told by even unattractive women, is only for the hot guys.  So average or unattractive guys' options to get experience  are diminished."
RiverMountain662,,,tryingtobeadoctor234,"But attractiveness is subjective. There are people with all types of preferences that don’t fit the conventional attractive features. If the woman isn’t attracted to you based solely off of looks I would think that’s a red flag in general. But if you want to be considered conventionally attractive so you’d have more options to choose from or better yet have those picky shallow women pick you because you met their standards is a losing battle.  Even if they pick you why would you value their opinion when they themselves are shallow and only good for looks or status symbols. The question here is what are you looking for and why, is it just for sex then you’ll fall into this cycle of unattainable standards to get a shallow man or woman. If you actually want a relationship it really doesn’t matter how you look because someone will find you attractive ( good hygiene goes a long way). Out of 8 Billion people there will be a couple thousand who would think your drop dead hot. We can never get self esteem boosts from others it’s short lived and unsatisfying. Confidence and love of yourself has to come from you. And that sort of confidence will translate with your flirting or talking to someone you like."
tryingtobeadoctor234,,,RiverMountain662,"I think that there has to be some level of physical attraction for a relationship to be feasible, otherwise it just is not going to work out.  For me, a woman can have the best personality, but if I am not attracted to her physical appearance, then she is going to find out and get hurt.  Just like how it is not enough for guys to be ""nice,"" it is not enough for a woman just to have a great personality.  She needs to be physically attractive is she is expecting a guy to exhaust himself to have the extra qualities she is looking for.

I think OP would like to meet the conventionally ""attractive"" women, because he just is not going to exhaust himself to meet the standards of conventionally unattractive women.  Not all unattractive women have this particular woman's mindset and delusion, but this old, haggard, unattractive woman is of the opinion that a man should exhaust himself to meet her standards.  What man is going to exhaust himself just to have sex with an ugly woman like her?

,,,RiverMountain662,"That lack of confidence could be a speech impediment, an indelible ""awkward/quirky"" personality, or a host of other reasons, not necessarily something awful.  I think the word ""creepy"" is an overused word that is unfairly directed mostly at men who do not fit a rigid, stereotypical criteria for ""cool.""  It's really dehumanizing and makes men not want to approach women altogether. 

Many of these men may lack ""confidence"" (whatever that truly means) is that what they say and do is not well received by people and they just don't feel accepted for who they are.  I appreciate your feedback."
RiverMountain662,,,tryingtobeadoctor234,"Right, subjectivity like most human interactions is here. But i think we’re saying similar things. Intentions, as long as the intentions aren’t one of pure usage or objectification on both parties sides then it’s fine. This can also apply to non heterosexual dating or flirting. Not having confidence is one things and forgivable. Approaching someone or talking to someone to only receive (sex or attention) can be crappy for all involved. Approach and talk to people you actually want to get to know and are sincere. The sincerity is attractive and sexy. In my opinion, the creepiness comes out when the person isn’t sincere or upfront about their motives.

RiverMountain662,,,tryingtobeadoctor234,"Well this goes into sex theory, men and women can fall into the role of pursuer and perused. Putting aside the fact that being more dominating or submissive in relationships are dependent on the individuals personal preferences, in your example the man is interacting with the woman based off of intention of getting to know them sparked by physical attraction. That is fine. The line, in my opinion, is when the man in this scenario doesn’t care about who she is only what she can do or give him. Being viewed as a full person compared to a sex object, intentions here are everything. My advice is focus on seeing someone who you like physically and going to talk to them to get to know them, not just get or expect sex from them. This leads to resentment from men towards women who they think are holding out on them for no reason other than looks or money or something trivial. There are people who are more than willing to do the hook up one night stand agreement, just be upfront and honest about it. It’s the men who want to turn every woman into that regardless of who they are or what they may want."

Even if they pick you why would you value their opinion when they themselves are shallow and only good for looks or status symbols. The question here is what are you looking for and why, is it just for sex then you’ll fall into this cycle of unattainable standards to get a shallow man or woman. If you actually want a relationship it really doesn’t matter how you look because someone will find you attractive ( good hygiene goes a long way). Out of 8 Billion people there will be a couple thousand who would think your drop dead hot. We can never get self esteem boosts from others it’s short lived and unsatisfying. Confidence and love of yourself has to come from you. And that sort of confidence will translate with your flirting or talking to someone you like."

For me, a woman can have the best personality, but if I am not attracted to her physical appearance, then she is going to find out and get hurt.  Just like how it is not enough for guys to be ""nice,"" it is not enough for a woman just to have a great personality.  She needs to be physically attractive is she is expecting a guy to exhaust himself to have the extra qualities she is looking for.

I think OP would like to meet the conventionally ""attractive"" women, because he just is not going to exhaust himself to meet the standards of conventionally unattractive women.  Not all unattractive women have this particular woman's mindset and delusion, but this old, haggard, unattractive woman is of the opinion that a man should exhaust himself to meet her standards.

Kappa Sigma is not recognized by UCR at all. For that matter, they’ve actually been condemned by various guilds for their hazing practices. If Kappa Sigma is not a fraternity affiliated with UCR in any way, why should Kappa Sigma be allowed to form a de-facto political party and continue voting their own into power while maintaining a chokehold over a community they’re not even a part of? This is in fact, a dishonest act, in accordance with Cambridge’s definition of rigging. 

On another note, a fraternity who was condemned for vandalizing other organizations with hate symbols does not deserve to be defended, be their elections rigged or not.

[deleted],,,TriG__,"""A chokehold over a community their not a part of"".  
What? A: They are a part of the UCR community so I don't really understand this. B: what chokehold? You say this like they're funneling money into their own accounts or writing legislation for their own benefit. Do you actually know how ASUCR works? Kappa sigma members are a minority within ASUCR, so I find this highly unlikely to happen in the first place as everything is voted on by the whole senate. Additionally, all legislation and funding passed by ASUCR is open to the public to look at, so you can read through all of it. I guarantee you don't find a single thing of note in relation to Kappa Sigma.  
  
Just because Kappa Sigma has never been on IFC at UCR doesn't mean they're some underground band of thugs or something like you're making it out to be. UCR's Kappa Sigma chapter is actually a top ranked chapter nationally within the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Unrecognized =/= dismissed. In your citation you linked the list of dismissed and unrecognized organizations. If you actually read the page, you'll quickly realize that the dismissed organizations are the ones who have been caught in malicious activities, and thus violates school policy to join. You'll notice that Kappa Sigma falls under the unrecognized section. This simply means that they've never been on the schools IFC. Nothing more. So anything relating to that which you've mentioned is moot (I notice you didn't cite your 'condemned by various guilds'). Sadly I think I'll need to spell it out for you: 'Why should they be allowed to participate in ASUCR?' because they are UCR students and are not in any violation of any school policy by being in Kappa Sigma, nor do their members in ASUCR violate any policies which would result in their removal. This is why they are allowed to LMAO.  
  
I honestly find it hard to believe that in your comment you bring up what another Kappa Sigma chapter at another school did. Like I don't even know where to begin, that is just a complete lack of critical thinking on your part. To act like each chapter of a fraternity is at all similar from campus to campus is laughably stupid. Putting that in your argument is just so incredibly irrelevant if you're trying to talk about a specific chapter of a fraternity.  
  
If you choose to ignore everything I just said, I would implore you to direct your questions/frustrations to any of the professional faculty working with/for ASUCR. I'm positive they could quash your very misguided qualms.

,,,tryingtobeadoctor234,"Well this goes into sex theory, men and women can fall into the role of pursuer and perused. Putting aside the fact that being more dominating or submissive in relationships are dependent on the individuals personal preferences, in your example the man is interacting with the woman based off of intention of getting to know them sparked by physical attraction. That is fine. The line, in my opinion, is when the man in this scenario doesn’t care about who she is only what she can do or give him. Being viewed as a full person compared to a sex object, intentions here are everything. My advice is focus on seeing someone who you like physically and going to talk to them to get to know them, not just get or expect sex from them. This leads to resentment from men towards women who they think are holding out on them for no reason other than looks or money or something trivial. There are people who are more than willing to do the hook up one night stand agreement, just be upfront and honest about it. It’s the men who want to turn every woman into that regardless of who they are or what they may want."
tryingtobeadoctor234,,,RiverMountain662,"That's fair, but even then there are several things men are expected to have just to be considered worthy, even by unattractive women.  

NSA, I have been told by even unattractive women, is only for the hot guys.  So average or unattractive guys' options to get experience  are diminished."
RiverMountain662,,,tryingtobeadoctor234,"But attractiveness is subjective. There are people with all types of preferences that don’t fit the conventional attractive features. If the woman isn’t attracted to you based solely off of looks I would think that’s a red flag in general. But if you want to be considered conventionally attractive so you’d have more options to choose from or better yet have those picky shallow women pick you because you met their standards is a losing battle.  Even if they pick you why would you value their opinion when they themselves are shallow and only good for looks or status symbols. The question here is what are you looking for and why, is it just for sex then you’ll fall into this cycle of unattainable standards to get a shallow man or woman. If you actually want a relationship it really doesn’t matter how you look because someone will find you attractive ( good hygiene goes a long way). Out of 8 Billion people there will be a couple thousand who would think your drop dead hot. We can never get self esteem boosts from others it’s short lived and unsatisfying. Confidence and love of yourself has to come from you. And that sort of confidence will translate with your flirting or talking to someone you like."
tryingtobeadoctor234,,,RiverMountain662,"I think that there has to be some level of physical attraction for a relationship to be feasible, otherwise it just is not going to work out.  For me, a woman can have the best personality, but if I am not attracted to her physical appearance, then she is going to find out and get hurt.  Just like how it is not enough for guys to be ""nice,"" it is not enough for a woman just to have a great personality.  She needs to be physically attractive is she is expecting a guy to exhaust himself to have the extra qualities she is looking for.

I think OP would like to meet the conventionally ""attractive"" women, because he just is not going to exhaust himself to meet the standards of conventionally unattractive women.  Not all unattractive women have this particular woman's mindset and delusion, but this old, haggard, unattractive woman is of the opinion that a man should exhaust himself to meet her standards.  What man is going to exhaust himself just to have sex with an ugly woman like her?

,,,TriG__,"""A chokehold over a community their not a part of"".  
What? A: They are a part of the UCR community so I don't really understand this. B: what chokehold? You say this like they're funneling money into their own accounts or writing legislation for their own benefit. Do you actually know how ASUCR works? Kappa sigma members are a minority within ASUCR, so I find this highly unlikely to happen in the first place as everything is voted on by the whole senate. Additionally, all legislation and funding passed by ASUCR is open to the public to look at, so you can read through all of it. I guarantee you don't find a single thing of note in relation to Kappa Sigma.  
  
Just because Kappa Sigma has never been on IFC at UCR doesn't mean they're some underground band of thugs or something like you're making it out to be. UCR's Kappa Sigma chapter is actually a top ranked chapter nationally within the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Unrecognized =/= dismissed. In your citation you linked the list of dismissed and unrecognized organizations. If you actually read the page, you'll quickly realize that the dismissed organizations are the ones who have been caught in malicious activities, and thus violates school policy to join. You'll notice that Kappa Sigma falls under the unrecognized section. This simply means that they've never been on the schools IFC. Nothing more. So anything relating to that which you've mentioned is moot (I notice you didn't cite your 'condemned by various guilds'). Sadly I think I'll need to spell it out for you: 'Why should they be allowed to participate in ASUCR?' because they are UCR students and are not in any violation of any school policy by being in Kappa Sigma, nor do their members in ASUCR violate any policies which would result in their removal. This is why they are allowed to LMAO.  
  
I honestly find it hard to believe that in your comment you bring up what another Kappa Sigma chapter at another school did. Like I don't even know where to begin, that is just a complete lack of critical thinking on your part. To act like each chapter of a fraternity is at all similar from campus to campus is laughably stupid. Putting that in your argument is just so incredibly irrelevant if you're trying to talk about a specific chapter of a fraternity.  
  
If you choose to ignore everything I just said, I would implore you to direct your questions/frustrations to any of the professional faculty working with/for ASUCR. I'm positive they could quash your very misguided qualms.  
  
Also I think you should change your username haha, thanks for playing my game though, friend :)"

,,,oaklandr8dr,"I am ADHD too and I was cutoff from college too.

I stayed with my grandpa to live and went to community college for mostly free on the board of governors fee waiver as financially independent from parents.

There are a lot of community colleges now totally free regardless of your status.

I ended up transferring to UCR as a transfer student and obtaining lot of scholarships and aid where I went mostly free with some work study and side work supplements.

I wasn’t formally diagnosed until after college. It was a struggle but it can be done.

I got kicked out of my first college with a 1.27 and got a 3.4 gpa in community college and finished UCR with a 2.8 it was tough.

I managed in my 30s to go to graduate school after ADHD treatment and I got a 3.8 GPA graduated with honors.

ADHD is a real handicap. I wish I was not told it’s not real by my parents and held back in life so long. Medication literally changed my life to the point of tears. I cried the first time I had my prescription because I said this is how ordinary people must feel all the time."

,,,AFO1031,"drop out and go into a community college. If you don’t have the skills to handle a 4 year, you should start out in something that’s much cheaper

also, go to the on site therapist to talk trough this 

they should be able to tell you what resources exist on campus to help with your grades 

if i’m not wrong, it’s also free to make an appointment and go"
,,,CommanderGO,"If you have autism, you should not be going for a bachelor's degree. It's really on you to figure out what you're lacking and looking for the resources you need for succeed despite the difficulties of autism. I'm somewhat lucky since my ADHD didn't impede by academic performance but would make me prone to making small errors and lose interest when people start bird walking.

If you want to be a business owner, it's more important that you understand what need your business is filling and where/who your market is. It's easy to learn a lot of business theory from college courses, but it ultimately isn't going to help you in the long run. If I were you, I would actually drop out of UCR to get an AA in business, and get yourself a job working for a small business to learn the skills of the trade."
,,,bluediamond612,"I really recommend you that to join the community college, and then transfer to universities. Not only save huge money, but also you can have a part time job to support yourself.

,,,Lord_Banana_14,"Some great series are Trigun, Durarara, Angel Beats, Violet Evergarden, Noragami, Death Parade, Madoka Magica, Mushokou Tensei, Bungou Stray Dogs, Kaguya-sama, and Oshi no Ko.

Anime movies are also really good, such those from Studio Ghibli (Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Howl’s Moving Castle, Grave of the Fireflies / The Boy and the Heron is currently out in theaters), Makoto Shinkai films (Your Name, Garden of Words, 5 Centimeters Per Second, and more recently, Suzume no Tojimari), and Satoshi Kon films (Paprika, Perfect Blue, Tokyo Godfathers).

Anime style games are also really good. Mobile games such as Genshin Impact, Fate/GO (including the Fate series anime), and Arknights. You can also go for more detailed content and creative games for consoles and PC such as Danganronpa (which has an anime series), the Persona series (which also has an anime), and Fire Emblem.

Just a few suggestions that have yet to be mentioned, but I think are still worth going into. Of course, if you’re an anime fan, always check out the mangas of your favorite anime’s, as well as some new ones that will be getting anime adaptations soon such as Kaiju No. 8, Dandadan, and Blue Box."
,,,backtracksVEVO,"KATANAGATARI - very similar historical setting to samurai champloo and gintama on this list, takes it in a very different direction. aired one double-length episode each month in 2010, written by the same author as the monogatari series. incredibly controversial and shoves off the concept of genre like shakespeare does in winter's tale. i love it a lot

MY NEXT LIFE AS A VILLAINESS: ALL ROUTES LEAD TO DOOM! - you are not above silliness. watch this and be more silly. get jiggy with it.

FLIP FLAPPERS - flip flap flip flap. tooi koe wo flip flip flap flip flap. tojikometa 

CHIHAYAFURU - you thought you were done with sports anime? you watched haikyuu and ping pong and yuri on ice and uma musume and keijo and thought you were done? you fool. you fell for one of the classic blunders. you forgot to trust in the heart of the cards. watch the incredibly niche interest somehow overtake everything in your heart that the general populace says is good strictly because it's for you and you own it.

MAQUIA - cry if you need to

,,,Emergency_Bug_5782,the school closed bruv
,,,Safe-Pineapple-4975,Campus is closed til 1/2 so no one is around to answer. But a lot depends on which major and college you're trying to switch to.
Safe-Pineapple-4975,,,Local-Sport-4085,I’m trying to switch from environmental engineering to mechanical engineering
Local-Sport-4085,,,Safe-Pineapple-4975,"Oh yeah, within the same college is way easier than between colleges."
Local-Sport-4085,,,Sleepyyypandawuh,Oof good luck. I tried doing that too. You can do it tho
,,,MisakiSan1,Depends on what major you want to switch to.
MisakiSan1,,,Local-Sport-4085,How do I know if they would allow me or not?
Local-Sport-4085,,,MisakiSan1,Typically academic advising won’t throw a fit if you’ve satisfied all the lower div requirements.
MisakiSan1,,,Local-Sport-4085,"They keep telling me different things, I gotta go in person"
Local-Sport-4085,,,MisakiSan1,"They should be open for dropins starting 1/9. Also, if you want to switch majors, I recommend taking advantage of second pass registration during week 1 or 2(forgot which)"
MisakiSan1,,,Local-Sport-4085,What is that? Sorry it’s my first quarter at ucr so I don’t know much
Local-Sport-4085,,,MisakiSan1,Second pass registration is when class registration opens up again to let people temporarily or permanently register for classes if they were not able to before. People usually use this to get into classes because spots opened up before the class started or to try out other classes before committing.
MisakiSan1,,,Local-Sport-4085,"So for example I wanted to take a class but I couldn’t because it was full, I’d still have a chance to enroll in it because they’re going to open the registration for it again during week 1 or 2?"
Local-Sport-4085,,,MisakiSan1,"You’ll be able to register so long as there are spots open, but yes in general that’s the gist"
MisakiSan1,,,Local-Sport-4085,Damn thats awesome
,,,Sleepyyypandawuh,"Look at how many units u have and the requirements you need to change your major. The units determine which grade level u are (junior or senior standing or whatever). You’ll see there are certain classes you’ll need to take in order to change it. Then see when those classes are offered. By the time you complete all of it, you contact or schedule a meeting with the counselor that’s in charge of the department you are trying to change to."
,,,FliQ910,"Wait to go in person. I went 2 weeks before the winter break and no one wanted to help. I was getting irritated until some academic advisor came out and helped us. Let alone our academic advisor was present and ignored us while rolling her eyes at us. Extremely Unprofessional. I’m happy another academic advisor helped instead of the one I was assigned. Bother them in person, that’s how you’ll get the help you need. Phone calls won’t do nor will emails. Sadly you gotta wait another 2 weeks or so"

HOW SHOULD I TAKE NOTES,2023-12-22 18:10:34,Remarkable-War-11,,
,,,Mountain-Nebula2441,"Personally, I prefer an iPad because I like having all my notes in one place on something that's easy to carry around. However, if buying one would put you in financial strain, it's not worth it and a paper and pencil will always be sufficient.

If you get an iPad for note-taking, you'd likely want one that is compatible with a pencil; this definitely is faster for taking notes compared to typing. I also recommend looking on eBay or some other resale app for a used one if you're looking to save money. Most of these sites come with some kind of buyer protection and you can get newer models for like half the price."
,,,ImpishNerd,"Whatever you use, something I want to recommend is try not to write everything that the instructor says down. Paper and pen, maybe iPad, are best, but it’s more important to make sure that you’re interpreting what your instructor says, getting down what you feel is the most important out of anything said. A lot of students try and cram, but that leaves out where the learning process happens, which is involved in you struggling to get down what you feel is the main theme, concepts."
,,,mechasmadness,"An ipad is great especially since you don't have to use a Pro model if you want to be able to use the pencil. You can use the smart folio/keyboard if you want but there's third party ones that aren't as expensive that should be able to get the job done. If it's too costly to get an iPad and the accessories, pen and paper works too."
,,,Just_Another_Andrew,"I was a paper note-taker for a long time but swapped over to using OneNote on a Surface. I still prefer to do problem sets on paper (it's a little more convenient to look at a past step quickly), but for general lecture notes and discussion going digital saves a ton of paper

That said, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Changing your note-taking medium isn't going to have a big effect on how well you absorb the material"
,,,antwan_benjamin,"Microsoft Surface tablet, plus surface pen, plus surface keyboard. Take ALL your notes in OneNote. You can even import classroom handouts (you gotta take a pic of them). Keeps all of your notes extremely organized.  

I have my previous setup I can sell you for a good price, send me a PM. It'll be MUCH cheaper than the ipad route, with more school features IMO since its fully integrated with all Office products"
,,,madkandy12,"I just type. I’ve learned to type as fast as the sun and I type faster and neater than I write. I have typos etc but I can’t write as fast as some of these profs talk or how fast they do their slides. 

I have a Microsoft surface 3 which is a touchscreen laptop where the screen disconnects from the keyboard and turns into a lil tablet it’s so lit. So I can do either one I want. I use the tablet to annotate and highlight readings/PDF’s mostly!!"

,,,MC_archer747,"Not sure about the last paragraph, I think most of us wanted to know why abortion was not an option or you chose not to do it. 

But, going to your post,  If you believe going to church more often will help that's your choice and I understand it. However you don't need to be close to your faith to be better, you should be aware and knowledgeable about what resources are avaliable for you and know your limits. 

I'm going to assume you grew up with religious parents who were strict about where you went and what you did. My best advice for you is to make friends who likely are smarter and more experienced with relationships so they can offer some valuable advice if you need help. Since you said you want to become a doctor start seeking people who are already ahead of you or are about to be a doctor and ask for their advise as well. 

Regardless, I hope you're doing well and ignore the haters. Some men are toxic (as a man myself). Focus on your goals and have fun while at ucr (while being safe and legal ofc)"

,,,Evanescentlyy,"Hi, current medical student here. I agree with what others have said about making an appt with the women's health center and finding an OBGYN that you can see regularly. Having a baby at a young age can be challenging especially when you arent sure what resources are out there, which is why making an appt at the women's health center is crucial.

Seeing an OBGYN will help because they can keep track of the baby throughout the pregnancy while also doing various tests to screen for certain abnormalities. This might be even more important for you because you said you drank while you were pregnant without knowing. Also, you should see them to see how much folic acid you need to be taking as it's generally recommended before pregnancy to avoid other abnormalities such as neural tube defects."
Evanescentlyy,,,SweetandSaltyFruit,This comment! Take your prenatal vitamins
Evanescentlyy,,,SAYPOR,"I really hope they take your advice, but considering how they ignored hundreds of comments giving good, valid advice and latched onto a single comment talking about the rare case of an open adoption gone well, it’s hard to have hope they’ll listen.

Friendliest_Virus,,,Silencer0000,Which is why they aren’t going to respond.
Silencer0000,,,MysterionX12,"Honestly if I knew a former partner was sleeping around and told me she got pregnant I would be suspicious as fuck. I would feel bad but from my understanding I would say we both made decisions and she has to deal with her decisions alone. It takes two to tango but if the other person is tangoing with everyone and their brother, then whose responsibility is the consequences really? It's harsh but that's the male perspective, and having that perspective does not make you a deadbeat but a reasonable skeptic."
MysterionX12,,,Friendliest_Virus,"Male perspective = slut shaming? That’s wild bro. I’d imagine that’s why she’s being mature and asking for paternity tests from partners so she knows who to make this decision with. It does take two to tango meaning not only did she not have sexual knowledge but the guy was also dumb enough to just say he’ll pull out. (Sorry if you’re reading this op. Again, don’t blame you fully)

Because if a guy sleeps around and gets a woman pregnant. He won’t get the same skeptical perspective would he? Respectfully. I know because my father was one of these people sleeping around with everyone and their sisters."
Friendliest_Virus,,,MysterionX12,"I mean biology is a wonderful field. I wonder if that could answer as to why society looks down on women for sleeping around and less so for men. If a man is sleeping around with a bunch of different women who don't have other sexual partners the question of who the father is, is not up for the question. Meanwhile in the same exact opposite situation a woman sleeping around with multiple men is essentially playing roulette. It's not right that one is looked down upon more so than the other but there are reasons why society does not see the two to be the same because they are not the same. You don't have to come to the same value judgment as society but understanding why society comes to these judgement values is why a lot of people go to school."
MysterionX12,,,tinaj12,Wow. So deep.
MysterionX12,,,escobarzzzzzz,If the paternity test flags you as the father….. you are the father. It’s not rocket science. Maybe you should learn common sense instead of being a moron on Reddit  😂
escobarzzzzzz,,,MysterionX12,There are so many documented cases of men having to pay child support despite negative paternity tests. I'm not saying this as a misogynist thing but from a legal perspective you have to cover your ass which could mean denying any test at all which literally any lawyer would advise you to do until it was certain you have to take a test. Perhaps before calling someone a moron on Reddit maybe consider why taking a paternity test may open you up to legal responsibilities. If you aren't in a field that pertains to legal and social issues why comment? If you were you would know this...
MysterionX12,,,tinaj12,"This makes no sense. 

If your partner is sleeping around. Get a paternity test. 

If it's negative, your work here is done 

If it's positive, you have a minimum 18 year commitment to AT LEAST financially provide for that child."

,,,toedude,Dude your baby is gonna have mad fetal alcohol syndrome
toedude,,,JuiceBoxcks,"My thoughts exactly, alcohol consumption during pregnancy is never a good thing"
JuiceBoxcks,,,toedude,Especially during the 1st trimester!!!
toedude,,,Datsmellstightdawg,You don’t know that. It’s actually common for a lot of women to not know they are pregnant for a while and consume alcohol. Doesn’t mean the baby will have fetal alcohol syndrome especially since she found out she was pregnant still while she was early in her pregnancy. I’ve known someone who didn’t know they were pregnant for months they drank and the baby was perfectly healthy. OP already knows she made a mistake and I’m sure she’ll learn from it so trying to make her feel even more like crap isn’t accomplishing anything.
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"You’re VERY wrong. Newer research shows that the fetal alcohol syndrome spectrum can start with such a small serving of alcohol. That’s why *no alcohol* is the standard when pregnant. Your friend or whatever may have a child that SEEMS perfectly healthy, but may end up with learning issues, emotional regulation problems, and more. It’s a spectrum disorder, their baby might be just lower on the spectrum"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Not wrong as I know someone who has gone through it. Baby was fine and does not have fetal alcohol syndrome you telling her her baby is definitely going to have fetal alcohol syndrome is not true. Also in some countries, like France, alcohol more particularly wine is actually common in pregnant women. As I mentioned before it is not uncommon for people to not know they are pregnant it’s actually pretty common, I was at a conference for school and I was talking to 2 classmates of mine who both didn’t know they were pregnant for awhile. In the major that I’m in everyone is hardcore drinkers both are their babies were born fine. Should it be normalized? No. Should we shame people who didn’t know they were pregnant and drank alcohol? Also no."
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"You are *not* a doctor. Just looking at a child does not give you enough information to say they’re fine. Interacting with them does not give enough information. Problems onset by FAS can come much later into the child’s life (pre teens-teens). If she had as much alcohol and drugs as she said she did, her baby WILL be on the FAS spectrum. Where they will be depends. Do some research instead of one interaction with a friends baby"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,When did I ever say I was a doctor don’t remember saying that at all…. This was a long time ago the first person I was talking about her child is a teenager now
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"When you said the baby was fine with no medical evidence. It’s crazy you’re in college and can’t comprehend you don’t have to always be explicit! To add to your edit, there are plenty of countries that normalize LOTS of things that aren’t healthy or backed by real research. You go to a college that specializes in research, utilize that :))"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,What evidence would you like me to provide you on Reddit with the charts and labs? I never said anything explicit. All I literally said is you do not know for 100% sure that this persons baby will be affected and I provided an example that I personally know. I never said alcohol is sooo safe in pregnancy everyone should get drunk and drink how much alcohol they want to. It’s obviously not safe and should be avoided but when people don’t know they are pregnant they obviously may drink. Sure the other countries aren’t backed by research that is true but if 100% of babies are not born with the syndrome you cannot say every single baby will be if a unknowing mother drinks many factors come into play.
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"Considering labs aren’t taken for FAS, I’m pretty sure you’re 1. Taking the mom’s word for it (who is assuming on her own bc there’s no *obvious issues* ) or  2. Just talking out your ass. Research is leaning towards the notion that even drinking while conceiving can cause issues! I get you’re trying to make this girl feel better, but acting like the odds are against that kid having FAS is not helping either. You’re giving her a false sense of reality. Just like the people telling her she’ll see her baby with an open adoption when more often then not, the adoptive parents close it back up as soon as possible"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,I realize it’s hard to tell over text but that was sarcasm…. Oh wow talking out of my ass how explicit of you
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,No shit…. Those are still my 2 leading theories😌
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,I never cursed at you once so just shows your character have a great day
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,Does saying “no shit” really equate to “cursing” at you. Just say you have no actual reasoning and move on. No need to pretend to take the high road bc I said “shit” and it hurt your feelings
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Hmm saying things like you’re talking out of your ass, and no shit in reply to what I’m saying is definitely cursing at me. You’re really mad at me for saying you cannot say that this person baby will have a  100% chance of have fetal alcohol syndrome. Absolutely insane."
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"I didn’t even know ass counts as a bad word 💀Again, she said she did a LOT of drinking and partying. The odds of her kid having issues is not low. She needs the cold hard truth bc this is a HUGE deal. Bringing a kid into the world is not a light decision. Like I said in the og post, she is the one who may have to deal with the worst consequences of any decision she makes. Having a baby with moderate/severe FAS is one of those consequences. Saying that everything may all be okay isn’t real helpful when the stakes are so high"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Yeah I don’t believe that at all. If you don’t know ass is a curse word I don’t know what to tell you. Wow I didn’t realize you were her doctor. That is not the cold hard truth that is speculation. As I said before if chances are not 100% it is speculation not actuality. Going around telling people to abort their babies because they might have a disorder but you don’t know for sure is disgusting. Yes, she is the one who has to deal with consequences. Yes it is helpful because it’s reality there is a chance that everything may be okay just like there is a chance that it may not be."
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"I never told her to abort bc her kid may have FAS. I do think she should abort, but that’s not why. There is a possibility that it will all work out (yay!). It’s way less likely that it will not. Best case scenario: A most likely single 18 year old mother who already said she’d drop out of college… or never seeing your kids bc people told you an open adoption means you can see your baby (adoptive parents will even lie about an open adoption to get your kid). She’s the one who has to deal with it the end, but it’s just really sad to see someone’s life take such a turn bc their parents failed them."
Datsmellstightdawg,,,JuiceBoxcks,"Sure there could’ve been a better way of bringing this up, but it’s still a very real possibility that needs to be acknowledged. The CDC as of October 2023 also says that “there is no known safe amount of alcohol use during pregnancy” nor any safe time for alcohol use, so one shouldn’t risk it."
JuiceBoxcks,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Right and I’m not saying that yeah alcohol is 100% safe during pregnancy so go crazy and drink all day every day. People should absolutely not risk it and not drink at all. But in cases where you don’t know you are pregnant, which is pretty common, people are going to continue their normal activities like drinking because they don’t know. I’m sure OP also isn’t dumb and knows substances can affect a fetus. So it’s just really unnecessary and speculation saying “your baby is going to have mad fetal alcohol syndrome.”"

,,,sc4rplatinum,"I’m not Catholic myself, but I’m a little confused about your perspective—if you’re even being serious, that is. I’m starting to think this is just rage bait because it’s hard to believe that somebody could be this unintentionally obtuse.

You have mixed feelings on getting an abortion because of your Catholicism but you engage in premarital sex? It’s an odd perspective is all, which is what leads me to sense the troll-like vibes emanating from your posts and comments.

In case this isn’t a joke, listen to every sane person who has responded to you and reschedule that appointment for an abortion. That kid’s life has a high chance of sucking donkey balls, open adoption or otherwise. The adoption system is fucked, the chances of your child being abused by the adopting family are not low by any means, and an open adoption can become closed *real* quick. And don’t forget that it is up to *you* to prevent that."
sc4rplatinum,,,sakiamane,"You’d be surprise how few “true catholics” there are, this isn’t really surprising. For my English 1B class I did an essay about Christianity and while doing research for it I found an article from Arizona Christian university that explained how only around 6% of Christians live fully according to their religion, most of them are lukewarm Christians."
sakiamane,,,Friendliest_Virus,It’s true. I was raised Christian but I don’t hold myself to all its teachings. Thus I have labeled myself “Chill Christian” because of how embarrassing it is to tell people
sc4rplatinum,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"As someone who was raised in catholic schooling most of the time even some “devout” Catholics view some things as unforgivable versus others. No one really follows every single rule unless you are a truly devout devout Catholic. Out of all the Catholics I’ve been around I’ve only met 1 like that who was actually devout and followed every rule in the book of Catholicism. Basically every person I knew in school, except for that 1, engaged in premarital sex but were completely against abortion and are pro life for their religious reasons 

Guilt tripping someone into having an abortion is just as bad as taking people ability away to choose. Did OP make terrible decisions? Yes. I think she knows that part"
Datsmellstightdawg,,,sc4rplatinum,"This is much worse than your average picking-and-choosing. Engage in sexual activity as much as you want. But if you're going to get pregnant, you have to keep in mind that childrearing is a serious responsibility. Are we going to just ignore that? This kid, if they're even real, has an incredibly high chance of suffering from birth. And the solution to that problem is present and within reach, but all of a sudden her religion matters. This is ridiculously selfish and narcissistic behavior. Fuck my religion if it means I get laid, but now I have to consider it when this kid who I clearly am not capable of taking care of could lead an awful life.

This is in no way guilt-tripping. I have no reason to guilt-trip; this will not affect me in any way whatsoever in the long run. This is just an admonition. OP can ignore everyone here and ruin the kid's life if that is truly what her heart desires. But she asked for advice earlier, so people are going to give it to her.

And If you seriously believe that some college student's opinion regarding some rando's approach to their unplanned pregnancy is equivalent to revoking bodily autonomy, I am concerned about your perspective on literally any matter of even the slightest importance."
sc4rplatinum,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Yeah that’s why I said did OP make terrible decisions? Yes. Because she absolutely did make so many terrible decisions that also put her at high risk of developing STDs having unprotected sex with multiple people. However, sex is normal and should be treated as such. You also have to realize there is some places where sexual education is not normalized/even taught at all. There’s states in the US that are actively trying to ban sexual education in schools. So sometimes it’s not even the fault of people but lack of education. If you are never taught about safe sex or sex at all it’s impossible to be properly informed. No, we are not ignoring that having a child is a big responsibility but that is not excuse to try to force someone into having an abortion.

You do not know for certain that this child has a high chance of suffering from birth? Does it look good with what we were presented? No. But there is no guideline that we can follow to say okay this baby will suffer but this baby will not suffer. A baby can be born to a single mother and thrive more than a baby born into a family. Being around Catholics for most of my life I don’t see it as “all of a sudden” her religion matters. Abortion is the main thing Catholics agree on. In high school we would have annual trips to march for Pro-life beliefs. For example that isn’t religious, illegal activity there are some things people view as absolute and some things people are more likely to turn a blind eye to such as stealing food because you are hungry versus murdering someone. Back to religion that’s why there is the word devout because you are committed to every aspect of the religion and follow every rule and every guideline. But you can still be a part of a religion and not be devout but follow a certain set of rules strictly. 

Being that I am a woman and having my autonomy threatened in my state I obviously don’t find a Reddit post and actual laws revoking autonomy equivalent…I’m not even sure how you came to that conclusion. However, language that you used can still promote these same ideals lawmakers have had that went into the making of such laws such as you saying “listen to sane people we know what we’re talking about about and you don’t.” What you said wasn’t phrased as an opinion at all that was a statement. An opinion is personally I think it will be difficult to raise a child and attend college. However you chose to go with listen to sane people and reschedule the abortion. See the difference?"

,,,Jamonde,"You need to understand that with this decision, you are bringing an entire person into this world. Your concern shouldn't be 'what are my parents going to say?', but not because that isn't important - because they are likely going to find out in some way, shape, or form. I hope that you can be honest with yourself and with them. You may need to go to them before you even know who the father is. Can you do that?

There's a lot that you need to talk about here, and I suggest you see a counselor, a doctor (OBGYN probably), and someone from the women's resource center at MINIMUM. You've made it abundantly obvious that you aren't really in a position to be a mother yet, and I think input from a doctor on health-related things is essential.

Not that it needs to be over-emphasized, but a common issue with a lot of folks who are raised Catholic in this country is that they 'don't believe in birth control/protection', or their parents/schools don't, so they don't get educated about proper sexual/reproductive health, yet still go out and have sex anyways. I am not condemning you, but I want to make clear that pregnancy is one of the things that can happen. You may also wish to seek out tests for common STI's, as the pull-out method definitely won't protect against those. Please, take your sexual health education seriously now that it's not just your life at stake anymore."
,,,Personal-Youth-2765,If you plan on keeping it you’re gonna have to eventually tell your parents even if they don’t adopt it cause you’re most likely going to have to move back with them to raise the baby unless you can afford you’re own place off campus since you won’t be allowed to stay at the dorms 😬

,,,According-Ear-9963,"Girl I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend going to the Women's Health Services and educating yourself on what exactly will happen if you have that baby. That comment you responded to about open adoptions is very misleading. Many people believe that open adoption is a type of relationship in which the adoptive family and birth parents meet frequently in person. They may envision constant phone calls and adoptive parents consulting with the birth mother on all parenting decisions. However, the truth is that an open adoption is not co-parenting, and once you give your child up, you are not its parent and your life will not be as entwined as you thought in your last comment.

I recommend that you carefully reconsider your decision and get an abortion. Having a baby already takes an immense toll on your body, but giving your child up for adoption will affect your mind and your hormones even more. You're still young, you have a life ahead of you, and you should not be going through this as a college freshman. One of the many positives of living in California is our pro-choice open-mindedness — **TAKE advantage of California's wide availability of abortion clinics**. Don't tell your parents. You don't have the means to take care of a child right now and dropping out of school will be a very big mistake in the long run. Graduate, get a degree and your life sorted. Become a doctor. It will be extremely difficult if you have that child, believe me.

One last thing, I cannot stress how important contraception is. I don't agree with the comments slutshaming you. You made a bad decision, I hope you learned your mistake. Sex is a natural human impulse, and you should not be shamed for something that we praise men for. However, while there's nothing wrong with having sex, there is something wrong with not using contraception. Birth control, IUD, Plan B, whatever. BUT DO SOMETHING. You can get contraception at the WELL for free. Please take advantage of it. And even with whatever contraception you're on, also make sure that the dude ur sleeping with has a condom. ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU'RE HAVING SEX WHEN HE HAS A CONDOM ON!!! I wish you the best of luck!!

It takes two to tango but if the other person is tangoing with everyone and their brother, then whose responsibility is the consequences really? It's harsh but that's the male perspective, and having that perspective does not make you a deadbeat but a reasonable skeptic."
MysterionX12,,,Friendliest_Virus,"Male perspective = slut shaming? That’s wild bro. I’d imagine that’s why she’s being mature and asking for paternity tests from partners so she knows who to make this decision with. It does take two to tango meaning not only did she not have sexual knowledge but the guy was also dumb enough to just say he’ll pull out. (Sorry if you’re reading this op. Again, don’t blame you fully)

Because if a guy sleeps around and gets a woman pregnant. He won’t get the same skeptical perspective would he? Respectfully. I know because my father was one of these people sleeping around with everyone and their sisters."
Friendliest_Virus,,,MysterionX12,"I mean biology is a wonderful field. I wonder if that could answer as to why society looks down on women for sleeping around and less so for men. If a man is sleeping around with a bunch of different women who don't have other sexual partners the question of who the father is, is not up for the question. Meanwhile in the same exact opposite situation a woman sleeping around with multiple men is essentially playing roulette. It's not right that one is looked down upon more so than the other but there are reasons why society does not see the two to be the same because they are not the same. You don't have to come to the same value judgment as society but understanding why society comes to these judgement values is why a lot of people go to school."

MysterionX12,,,escobarzzzzzz,If the paternity test flags you as the father….. you are the father. It’s not rocket science. Maybe you should learn common sense instead of being a moron on Reddit  😂
escobarzzzzzz,,,MysterionX12,There are so many documented cases of men having to pay child support despite negative paternity tests. I'm not saying this as a misogynist thing but from a legal perspective you have to cover your ass which could mean denying any test at all which literally any lawyer would advise you to do until it was certain you have to take a test. Perhaps before calling someone a moron on Reddit maybe consider why taking a paternity test may open you up to legal responsibilities. If you aren't in a field that pertains to legal and social issues why comment? If you were you would know this...
MysterionX12,,,tinaj12,"This makes no sense. 

If your partner is sleeping around. Get a paternity test.

,,,JuiceBoxcks,"My thoughts exactly, alcohol consumption during pregnancy is never a good thing"
JuiceBoxcks,,,toedude,Especially during the 1st trimester!!!
,,,Datsmellstightdawg,You don’t know that. It’s actually common for a lot of women to not know they are pregnant for a while and consume alcohol. Doesn’t mean the baby will have fetal alcohol syndrome especially since she found out she was pregnant still while she was early in her pregnancy. I’ve known someone who didn’t know they were pregnant for months they drank and the baby was perfectly healthy. OP already knows she made a mistake and I’m sure she’ll learn from it so trying to make her feel even more like crap isn’t accomplishing anything.
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"You’re VERY wrong. Newer research shows that the fetal alcohol syndrome spectrum can start with such a small serving of alcohol. That’s why *no alcohol* is the standard when pregnant. Your friend or whatever may have a child that SEEMS perfectly healthy, but may end up with learning issues, emotional regulation problems, and more. It’s a spectrum disorder, their baby might be just lower on the spectrum"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Not wrong as I know someone who has gone through it. Baby was fine and does not have fetal alcohol syndrome you telling her her baby is definitely going to have fetal alcohol syndrome is not true. Also in some countries, like France, alcohol more particularly wine is actually common in pregnant women. As I mentioned before it is not uncommon for people to not know they are pregnant it’s actually pretty common, I was at a conference for school and I was talking to 2 classmates of mine who both didn’t know they were pregnant for awhile. In the major that I’m in everyone is hardcore drinkers both are their babies were born fine. Should it be normalized? No. Should we shame people who didn’t know they were pregnant and drank alcohol? Also no."
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"You are *not* a doctor. Just looking at a child does not give you enough information to say they’re fine. Interacting with them does not give enough information. Problems onset by FAS can come much later into the child’s life (pre teens-teens). If she had as much alcohol and drugs as she said she did, her baby WILL be on the FAS spectrum. Where they will be depends. Do some research instead of one interaction with a friends baby"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,When did I ever say I was a doctor don’t remember saying that at all…. This was a long time ago the first person I was talking about her child is a teenager now
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"When you said the baby was fine with no medical evidence. It’s crazy you’re in college and can’t comprehend you don’t have to always be explicit! To add to your edit, there are plenty of countries that normalize LOTS of things that aren’t healthy or backed by real research. You go to a college that specializes in research, utilize that :))"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,What evidence would you like me to provide you on Reddit with the charts and labs? I never said anything explicit. All I literally said is you do not know for 100% sure that this persons baby will be affected and I provided an example that I personally know. I never said alcohol is sooo safe in pregnancy everyone should get drunk and drink how much alcohol they want to. It’s obviously not safe and should be avoided but when people don’t know they are pregnant they obviously may drink. Sure the other countries aren’t backed by research that is true but if 100% of babies are not born with the syndrome you cannot say every single baby will be if a unknowing mother drinks many factors come into play.
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"Considering labs aren’t taken for FAS, I’m pretty sure you’re 1. Taking the mom’s word for it (who is assuming on her own bc there’s no *obvious issues* ) or  2. Just talking out your ass. Research is leaning towards the notion that even drinking while conceiving can cause issues! I get you’re trying to make this girl feel better, but acting like the odds are against that kid having FAS is not helping either. You’re giving her a false sense of reality. Just like the people telling her she’ll see her baby with an open adoption when more often then not, the adoptive parents close it back up as soon as possible"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,I realize it’s hard to tell over text but that was sarcasm…. Oh wow talking out of my ass how explicit of you
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,No shit…. Those are still my 2 leading theories😌
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,I never cursed at you once so just shows your character have a great day
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,Does saying “no shit” really equate to “cursing” at you. Just say you have no actual reasoning and move on. No need to pretend to take the high road bc I said “shit” and it hurt your feelings
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Hmm saying things like you’re talking out of your ass, and no shit in reply to what I’m saying is definitely cursing at me. You’re really mad at me for saying you cannot say that this person baby will have a  100% chance of have fetal alcohol syndrome. Absolutely insane."
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"I didn’t even know ass counts as a bad word 💀Again, she said she did a LOT of drinking and partying. The odds of her kid having issues is not low. She needs the cold hard truth bc this is a HUGE deal. Bringing a kid into the world is not a light decision. Like I said in the og post, she is the one who may have to deal with the worst consequences of any decision she makes. Having a baby with moderate/severe FAS is one of those consequences. Saying that everything may all be okay isn’t real helpful when the stakes are so high"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Yeah I don’t believe that at all. If you don’t know ass is a curse word I don’t know what to tell you. Wow I didn’t realize you were her doctor. That is not the cold hard truth that is speculation. As I said before if chances are not 100% it is speculation not actuality. Going around telling people to abort their babies because they might have a disorder but you don’t know for sure is disgusting. Yes, she is the one who has to deal with consequences.

Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"I never told her to abort bc her kid may have FAS. I do think she should abort, but that’s not why. There is a possibility that it will all work out (yay!). It’s way less likely that it will not. Best case scenario: A most likely single 18 year old mother who already said she’d drop out of college… or never seeing your kids bc people told you an open adoption means you can see your baby (adoptive parents will even lie about an open adoption to get your kid).

sakiamane,,,Friendliest_Virus,It’s true. I was raised Christian but I don’t hold myself to all its teachings. Thus I have labeled myself “Chill Christian” because of how embarrassing it is to tell people
,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"As someone who was raised in catholic schooling most of the time even some “devout” Catholics view some things as unforgivable versus others. No one really follows every single rule unless you are a truly devout devout Catholic. Out of all the Catholics I’ve been around I’ve only met 1 like that who was actually devout and followed every rule in the book of Catholicism. Basically every person I knew in school, except for that 1, engaged in premarital sex but were completely against abortion and are pro life for their religious reasons 

Guilt tripping someone into having an abortion is just as bad as taking people ability away to choose. Did OP make terrible decisions? Yes. I think she knows that part"
Datsmellstightdawg,,,sc4rplatinum,"This is much worse than your average picking-and-choosing. Engage in sexual activity as much as you want. But if you're going to get pregnant, you have to keep in mind that childrearing is a serious responsibility. Are we going to just ignore that? This kid, if they're even real, has an incredibly high chance of suffering from birth. And the solution to that problem is present and within reach, but all of a sudden her religion matters. This is ridiculously selfish and narcissistic behavior. Fuck my religion if it means I get laid, but now I have to consider it when this kid who I clearly am not capable of taking care of could lead an awful life.

This is in no way guilt-tripping. I have no reason to guilt-trip; this will not affect me in any way whatsoever in the long run. This is just an admonition. OP can ignore everyone here and ruin the kid's life if that is truly what her heart desires. But she asked for advice earlier, so people are going to give it to her.

And If you seriously believe that some college student's opinion regarding some rando's approach to their unplanned pregnancy is equivalent to revoking bodily autonomy, I am concerned about your perspective on literally any matter of even the slightest importance."
sc4rplatinum,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Yeah that’s why I said did OP make terrible decisions? Yes. Because she absolutely did make so many terrible decisions that also put her at high risk of developing STDs having unprotected sex with multiple people. However, sex is normal and should be treated as such. You also have to realize there is some places where sexual education is not normalized/even taught at all. There’s states in the US that are actively trying to ban sexual education in schools. So sometimes it’s not even the fault of people but lack of education. If you are never taught about safe sex or sex at all it’s impossible to be properly informed. No, we are not ignoring that having a child is a big responsibility but that is not excuse to try to force someone into having an abortion.

You do not know for certain that this child has a high chance of suffering from birth? Does it look good with what we were presented? No. But there is no guideline that we can follow to say okay this baby will suffer but this baby will not suffer. A baby can be born to a single mother and thrive more than a baby born into a family. Being around Catholics for most of my life I don’t see it as “all of a sudden” her religion matters. Abortion is the main thing Catholics agree on. In high school we would have annual trips to march for Pro-life beliefs. For example that isn’t religious, illegal activity there are some things people view as absolute and some things people are more likely to turn a blind eye to such as stealing food because you are hungry versus murdering someone. Back to religion that’s why there is the word devout because you are committed to every aspect of the religion and follow every rule and every guideline. But you can still be a part of a religion and not be devout but follow a certain set of rules strictly. 

Being that I am a woman and having my autonomy threatened in my state I obviously don’t find a Reddit post and actual laws revoking autonomy equivalent…I’m not even sure how you came to that conclusion. However, language that you used can still promote these same ideals lawmakers have had that went into the making of such laws such as you saying “listen to sane people we know what we’re talking about about and you don’t.” What you said wasn’t phrased as an opinion at all that was a statement.

Silencer0000,,,MysterionX12,"Honestly if I knew a former partner was sleeping around and told me she got pregnant I would be suspicious as fuck. I would feel bad but from my understanding I would say we both made decisions and she has to deal with her decisions alone. It takes two to tango but if the other person is tangoing with everyone and their brother, then whose responsibility is the consequences really? It's harsh but that's the male perspective, and having that perspective does not make you a deadbeat but a reasonable skeptic."
MysterionX12,,,Friendliest_Virus,"Male perspective = slut shaming? That’s wild bro. I’d imagine that’s why she’s being mature and asking for paternity tests from partners so she knows who to make this decision with. It does take two to tango meaning not only did she not have sexual knowledge but the guy was also dumb enough to just say he’ll pull out. (Sorry if you’re reading this op. Again, don’t blame you fully)

Because if a guy sleeps around and gets a woman pregnant. He won’t get the same skeptical perspective would he? Respectfully. I know because my father was one of these people sleeping around with everyone and their sisters."
Friendliest_Virus,,,MysterionX12,"I mean biology is a wonderful field. I wonder if that could answer as to why society looks down on women for sleeping around and less so for men. If a man is sleeping around with a bunch of different women who don't have other sexual partners the question of who the father is, is not up for the question. Meanwhile in the same exact opposite situation a woman sleeping around with multiple men is essentially playing roulette. It's not right that one is looked down upon more so than the other but there are reasons why society does not see the two to be the same because they are not the same. You don't have to come to the same value judgment as society but understanding why society comes to these judgement values is why a lot of people go to school."
MysterionX12,,,tinaj12,Wow. So deep.
MysterionX12,,,escobarzzzzzz,If the paternity test flags you as the father….. you are the father. It’s not rocket science. Maybe you should learn common sense instead of being a moron on Reddit  😂
escobarzzzzzz,,,MysterionX12,There are so many documented cases of men having to pay child support despite negative paternity tests. I'm not saying this as a misogynist thing but from a legal perspective you have to cover your ass which could mean denying any test at all which literally any lawyer would advise you to do until it was certain you have to take a test. Perhaps before calling someone a moron on Reddit maybe consider why taking a paternity test may open you up to legal responsibilities. If you aren't in a field that pertains to legal and social issues why comment? If you were you would know this...
MysterionX12,,,tinaj12,"This makes no sense. 

If your partner is sleeping around. Get a paternity test. 

If it's negative, your work here is done 

If it's positive, you have a minimum 18 year commitment to AT LEAST financially provide for that child."
,,,toedude,Especially during the 1st trimester!!!
,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"You’re VERY wrong. Newer research shows that the fetal alcohol syndrome spectrum can start with such a small serving of alcohol. That’s why *no alcohol* is the standard when pregnant. Your friend or whatever may have a child that SEEMS perfectly healthy, but may end up with learning issues, emotional regulation problems, and more. It’s a spectrum disorder, their baby might be just lower on the spectrum"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Not wrong as I know someone who has gone through it. Baby was fine and does not have fetal alcohol syndrome you telling her her baby is definitely going to have fetal alcohol syndrome is not true. Also in some countries, like France, alcohol more particularly wine is actually common in pregnant women. As I mentioned before it is not uncommon for people to not know they are pregnant it’s actually pretty common, I was at a conference for school and I was talking to 2 classmates of mine who both didn’t know they were pregnant for awhile. In the major that I’m in everyone is hardcore drinkers both are their babies were born fine. Should it be normalized? No. Should we shame people who didn’t know they were pregnant and drank alcohol? Also no."
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"You are *not* a doctor. Just looking at a child does not give you enough information to say they’re fine. Interacting with them does not give enough information. Problems onset by FAS can come much later into the child’s life (pre teens-teens). If she had as much alcohol and drugs as she said she did, her baby WILL be on the FAS spectrum. Where they will be depends. Do some research instead of one interaction with a friends baby"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,When did I ever say I was a doctor don’t remember saying that at all…. This was a long time ago the first person I was talking about her child is a teenager now
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"When you said the baby was fine with no medical evidence. It’s crazy you’re in college and can’t comprehend you don’t have to always be explicit! To add to your edit, there are plenty of countries that normalize LOTS of things that aren’t healthy or backed by real research. You go to a college that specializes in research, utilize that :))"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,What evidence would you like me to provide you on Reddit with the charts and labs? I never said anything explicit. All I literally said is you do not know for 100% sure that this persons baby will be affected and I provided an example that I personally know. I never said alcohol is sooo safe in pregnancy everyone should get drunk and drink how much alcohol they want to. It’s obviously not safe and should be avoided but when people don’t know they are pregnant they obviously may drink. Sure the other countries aren’t backed by research that is true but if 100% of babies are not born with the syndrome you cannot say every single baby will be if a unknowing mother drinks many factors come into play.
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"Considering labs aren’t taken for FAS, I’m pretty sure you’re 1. Taking the mom’s word for it (who is assuming on her own bc there’s no *obvious issues* ) or  2. Just talking out your ass. Research is leaning towards the notion that even drinking while conceiving can cause issues! I get you’re trying to make this girl feel better, but acting like the odds are against that kid having FAS is not helping either. You’re giving her a false sense of reality. Just like the people telling her she’ll see her baby with an open adoption when more often then not, the adoptive parents close it back up as soon as possible"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,I realize it’s hard to tell over text but that was sarcasm…. Oh wow talking out of my ass how explicit of you
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,No shit…. Those are still my 2 leading theories😌
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,I never cursed at you once so just shows your character have a great day
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,Does saying “no shit” really equate to “cursing” at you. Just say you have no actual reasoning and move on. No need to pretend to take the high road bc I said “shit” and it hurt your feelings
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Hmm saying things like you’re talking out of your ass, and no shit in reply to what I’m saying is definitely cursing at me. You’re really mad at me for saying you cannot say that this person baby will have a  100% chance of have fetal alcohol syndrome. Absolutely insane."
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"I didn’t even know ass counts as a bad word 💀Again, she said she did a LOT of drinking and partying. The odds of her kid having issues is not low.

I would feel bad but from my understanding I would say we both made decisions and she has to deal with her decisions alone. It takes two to tango but if the other person is tangoing with everyone and their brother, then whose responsibility is the consequences really? It's harsh but that's the male perspective, and having that perspective does not make you a deadbeat but a reasonable skeptic."
MysterionX12,,,Friendliest_Virus,"Male perspective = slut shaming? That’s wild bro. I’d imagine that’s why she’s being mature and asking for paternity tests from partners so she knows who to make this decision with. It does take two to tango meaning not only did she not have sexual knowledge but the guy was also dumb enough to just say he’ll pull out. (Sorry if you’re reading this op. Again, don’t blame you fully)

Because if a guy sleeps around and gets a woman pregnant. He won’t get the same skeptical perspective would he? Respectfully. I know because my father was one of these people sleeping around with everyone and their sisters."
Friendliest_Virus,,,MysterionX12,"I mean biology is a wonderful field. I wonder if that could answer as to why society looks down on women for sleeping around and less so for men. If a man is sleeping around with a bunch of different women who don't have other sexual partners the question of who the father is, is not up for the question. Meanwhile in the same exact opposite situation a woman sleeping around with multiple men is essentially playing roulette. It's not right that one is looked down upon more so than the other but there are reasons why society does not see the two to be the same because they are not the same. You don't have to come to the same value judgment as society but understanding why society comes to these judgement values is why a lot of people go to school."
MysterionX12,,,tinaj12,Wow. So deep.
MysterionX12,,,escobarzzzzzz,If the paternity test flags you as the father….. you are the father. It’s not rocket science. Maybe you should learn common sense instead of being a moron on Reddit  😂
escobarzzzzzz,,,MysterionX12,There are so many documented cases of men having to pay child support despite negative paternity tests. I'm not saying this as a misogynist thing but from a legal perspective you have to cover your ass which could mean denying any test at all which literally any lawyer would advise you to do until it was certain you have to take a test. Perhaps before calling someone a moron on Reddit maybe consider why taking a paternity test may open you up to legal responsibilities. If you aren't in a field that pertains to legal and social issues why comment? If you were you would know this...
MysterionX12,,,tinaj12,"This makes no sense. 

If your partner is sleeping around. Get a paternity test. 

If it's negative, your work here is done 

If it's positive, you have a minimum 18 year commitment to AT LEAST financially provide for that child."
,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Not wrong as I know someone who has gone through it. Baby was fine and does not have fetal alcohol syndrome you telling her her baby is definitely going to have fetal alcohol syndrome is not true. Also in some countries, like France, alcohol more particularly wine is actually common in pregnant women. As I mentioned before it is not uncommon for people to not know they are pregnant it’s actually pretty common, I was at a conference for school and I was talking to 2 classmates of mine who both didn’t know they were pregnant for awhile. In the major that I’m in everyone is hardcore drinkers both are their babies were born fine. Should it be normalized? No. Should we shame people who didn’t know they were pregnant and drank alcohol? Also no."
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"You are *not* a doctor. Just looking at a child does not give you enough information to say they’re fine. Interacting with them does not give enough information. Problems onset by FAS can come much later into the child’s life (pre teens-teens). If she had as much alcohol and drugs as she said she did, her baby WILL be on the FAS spectrum. Where they will be depends. Do some research instead of one interaction with a friends baby"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,When did I ever say I was a doctor don’t remember saying that at all…. This was a long time ago the first person I was talking about her child is a teenager now
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"When you said the baby was fine with no medical evidence. It’s crazy you’re in college and can’t comprehend you don’t have to always be explicit! To add to your edit, there are plenty of countries that normalize LOTS of things that aren’t healthy or backed by real research. You go to a college that specializes in research, utilize that :))"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,What evidence would you like me to provide you on Reddit with the charts and labs? I never said anything explicit. All I literally said is you do not know for 100% sure that this persons baby will be affected and I provided an example that I personally know. I never said alcohol is sooo safe in pregnancy everyone should get drunk and drink how much alcohol they want to. It’s obviously not safe and should be avoided but when people don’t know they are pregnant they obviously may drink. Sure the other countries aren’t backed by research that is true but if 100% of babies are not born with the syndrome you cannot say every single baby will be if a unknowing mother drinks many factors come into play.
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"Considering labs aren’t taken for FAS, I’m pretty sure you’re 1. Taking the mom’s word for it (who is assuming on her own bc there’s no *obvious issues* ) or  2. Just talking out your ass. Research is leaning towards the notion that even drinking while conceiving can cause issues! I get you’re trying to make this girl feel better, but acting like the odds are against that kid having FAS is not helping either. You’re giving her a false sense of reality. Just like the people telling her she’ll see her baby with an open adoption when more often then not, the adoptive parents close it back up as soon as possible"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,I realize it’s hard to tell over text but that was sarcasm…. Oh wow talking out of my ass how explicit of you
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,No shit…. Those are still my 2 leading theories😌
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,I never cursed at you once so just shows your character have a great day
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,Does saying “no shit” really equate to “cursing” at you. Just say you have no actual reasoning and move on. No need to pretend to take the high road bc I said “shit” and it hurt your feelings
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Hmm saying things like you’re talking out of your ass, and no shit in reply to what I’m saying is definitely cursing at me. You’re really mad at me for saying you cannot say that this person baby will have a  100% chance of have fetal alcohol syndrome. Absolutely insane."
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"I didn’t even know ass counts as a bad word 💀Again, she said she did a LOT of drinking and partying. The odds of her kid having issues is not low. She needs the cold hard truth bc this is a HUGE deal. Bringing a kid into the world is not a light decision. Like I said in the og post, she is the one who may have to deal with the worst consequences of any decision she makes. Having a baby with moderate/severe FAS is one of those consequences. Saying that everything may all be okay isn’t real helpful when the stakes are so high"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Yeah I don’t believe that at all. If you don’t know ass is a curse word I don’t know what to tell you. Wow I didn’t realize you were her doctor. That is not the cold hard truth that is speculation. As I said before if chances are not 100% it is speculation not actuality. Going around telling people to abort their babies because they might have a disorder but you don’t know for sure is disgusting. Yes, she is the one who has to deal with consequences. Yes it is helpful because it’s reality there is a chance that everything may be okay just like there is a chance that it may not be."
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"I never told her to abort bc her kid may have FAS. I do think she should abort, but that’s not why. There is a possibility that it will all work out (yay!). It’s way less likely that it will not. Best case scenario: A most likely single 18 year old mother who already said she’d drop out of college… or never seeing your kids bc people told you an open adoption means you can see your baby (adoptive parents will even lie about an open adoption to get your kid). She’s the one who has to deal with it the end, but it’s just really sad to see someone’s life take such a turn bc their parents failed them."
,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Right and I’m not saying that yeah alcohol is 100% safe during pregnancy so go crazy and drink all day every day. People should absolutely not risk it and not drink at all. But in cases where you don’t know you are pregnant, which is pretty common, people are going to continue their normal activities like drinking because they don’t know. I’m sure OP also isn’t dumb and knows substances can affect a fetus. So it’s just really unnecessary and speculation saying “your baby is going to have mad fetal alcohol syndrome.”"
Datsmellstightdawg,,,JuiceBoxcks,"True, only an actual doctor can say what’s what. Whichever path she chooses, I sincerely wish her the best."
JuiceBoxcks,,,Datsmellstightdawg,Same here
,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Yeah that’s why I said did OP make terrible decisions? Yes. Because she absolutely did make so many terrible decisions that also put her at high risk of developing STDs having unprotected sex with multiple people. However, sex is normal and should be treated as such. You also have to realize there is some places where sexual education is not normalized/even taught at all. There’s states in the US that are actively trying to ban sexual education in schools. So sometimes it’s not even the fault of people but lack of education. If you are never taught about safe sex or sex at all it’s impossible to be properly informed. No, we are not ignoring that having a child is a big responsibility but that is not excuse to try to force someone into having an abortion.

You do not know for certain that this child has a high chance of suffering from birth? Does it look good with what we were presented? No. But there is no guideline that we can follow to say okay this baby will suffer but this baby will not suffer. A baby can be born to a single mother and thrive more than a baby born into a family. Being around Catholics for most of my life I don’t see it as “all of a sudden” her religion matters. Abortion is the main thing Catholics agree on. In high school we would have annual trips to march for Pro-life beliefs. For example that isn’t religious, illegal activity there are some things people view as absolute and some things people are more likely to turn a blind eye to such as stealing food because you are hungry versus murdering someone. Back to religion that’s why there is the word devout because you are committed to every aspect of the religion and follow every rule and every guideline. But you can still be a part of a religion and not be devout but follow a certain set of rules strictly. 

Being that I am a woman and having my autonomy threatened in my state I obviously don’t find a Reddit post and actual laws revoking autonomy equivalent…I’m not even sure how you came to that conclusion. However, language that you used can still promote these same ideals lawmakers have had that went into the making of such laws such as you saying “listen to sane people we know what we’re talking about about and you don’t.” What you said wasn’t phrased as an opinion at all that was a statement. An opinion is personally I think it will be difficult to raise a child and attend college. However you chose to go with listen to sane people and reschedule the abortion. See the difference?"

I never said alcohol is sooo safe in pregnancy everyone should get drunk and drink how much alcohol they want to. It’s obviously not safe and should be avoided but when people don’t know they are pregnant they obviously may drink. Sure the other countries aren’t backed by research that is true but if 100% of babies are not born with the syndrome you cannot say every single baby will be if a unknowing mother drinks many factors come into play.
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,"Considering labs aren’t taken for FAS, I’m pretty sure you’re 1. Taking the mom’s word for it (who is assuming on her own bc there’s no *obvious issues* ) or  2. Just talking out your ass. Research is leaning towards the notion that even drinking while conceiving can cause issues! I get you’re trying to make this girl feel better, but acting like the odds are against that kid having FAS is not helping either. You’re giving her a false sense of reality. Just like the people telling her she’ll see her baby with an open adoption when more often then not, the adoptive parents close it back up as soon as possible"
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,I realize it’s hard to tell over text but that was sarcasm…. Oh wow talking out of my ass how explicit of you
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,No shit…. Those are still my 2 leading theories😌
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,I never cursed at you once so just shows your character have a great day
Datsmellstightdawg,,,Fluffy_Victory6254,Does saying “no shit” really equate to “cursing” at you. Just say you have no actual reasoning and move on. No need to pretend to take the high road bc I said “shit” and it hurt your feelings
Fluffy_Victory6254,,,Datsmellstightdawg,"Hmm saying things like you’re talking out of your ass, and no shit in reply to what I’m saying is definitely cursing at me.

Like I said in the og post, she is the one who may have to deal with the worst consequences of any decision she makes. Having a baby with moderate/severe FAS is one of those consequences.

Any advice on burnout?,2023-12-21 10:46:44,_meow_02,,
,,,HoneyBunny0-0,"I feel this too, I’m also a junior. I took out loans and worked 2 jobs and still could barely afford anything. I feel so burnout and also didn’t learn anything for the last 2 years and 1 quarter. I think for ur situation, definitely work less and borrow loans. It will definitely help out a lot and give u time to relax. I hope everything goes well for u and u got this, almost there 🎓"
HoneyBunny0-0,,,_meow_02,Same for you thank you!
_meow_02,,,KingDominoTheSecond,"OP,  please keep in mind that taking out loans is a LAST LAST LAST case scenario. Loans can easily ruin your life. EASILY. You could see your personal and financial growth be stunted for years if you can't keep up with the loan payments. The interest rates on a lot of these personal loans or payday loans are ridiculous too and you'd spend so much more money on those. If you end up needing to declare bankruptcy because the loan payments are too much, you will have to buy everything cash for the next 10 years, including cars and houses.

If you're working 50 hours per week and still can't afford anything, I highly recommend looking into lifestyle changes instead, maybe a different job if possible, or cutting back on expenses. Do a self audit of where you're spending money and what can be cut back. Just don't do a loan if you really don't have to, and if you do need a loan do your research please."
KingDominoTheSecond,,,ApprehensiveOil7142,"Goes without saying you should only take out federal loans, subsidized only if possible."
KingDominoTheSecond,,,bkab34,"Not sure why you’re so afraid of loans. I took out loans, didn’t work, and used my time to network and learn skills. Had no issue finding a job and my loan payment is not a big deal at all"
bkab34,,,KingDominoTheSecond,"""Not sure why you're so afraid of loans"" is a phrase said by someone who has no clue how easily taking out the wrong loan at the wrong time for the wrong reason could ruin your financial future. Any loans you take out must be thoroughly researched and you have to plan out exactly how you are going to pay it back. It's not just free money now in return for a monthly payment later, it's a huge financial decision and should be treated as such. Even if you're perfectly capable of paying back the loan, just the fact that you took out a loan could impact you when you go to buy a car, or a house, or if you find yourself in a major emergency where you need to use your credit for immediate funds that exceed what you could put down at the moment. Ideally you'd never have to take out a loan, but unfortunately we live in the real world where loans are sometimes necessary. But if you do need a loan, it shouldn't be supporting you just living, that's what work is for. Instead loans are ideally used for making large purchases possible, or to generate immediate capital that could be used to start a business (set up costs and buying supplies), or in emergencies (medical, car repairs, home repairs, or an urgent purchase). And it's unwise to assume everyone else is as good with money as you. For every person that uses a loan wisely and can easily make the payments back, there are two people who can't control their spending and drown in the payments or fall into collections. Obviously this advice isn't black and white, and I'm not saying OP definitely shouldn't get a loan. Just be cautious when borrowing, especially if you don't really know the implications."
,,,Jamonde,"If you have to work, is it possible to seek out internships/jobs related to your field that could support you instead? It may not solve the 'being overworked' problem but it may help with grad/professional school or at least finding work later."
,,,Smoked69,"Welcome to American capitalism. Where education is costly and you must pay to play to live. Or, indebt yourself for an education."
,,,jasmine_violet,unfortunately i did the same thing. i graduated and i did bad in a couple of classes while i was working. it really affected my ability to get into graduate programs. i’m done paying off my loans but i wish i took more out and focused on doing better while at UCR
,,,ChuckG04,"My advice (please read):

If you’re able to work a little less, then do so. 50+ hour  weeks is too much. Again, I understand that you need to work to go to school. If you’re unable to work less hours then you MUST find ONE day to completely rest in. Just one day. Even if you work on that day, then clear everything else so that even if you do work, you’ll at least not do anything that counts as “working” or “studying”. Just one day of quality rest is what you need to recharge. When I say “rest” I mean something that you genuinely enjoy doing or gives you some sort of satisfaction. That doesn’t have to mean watching Netflix for the entire day. Resting can mean reading a book or taking a walk.

Another thing: you gotta change your mindset towards what “work and college” is. Is college exhausting? YES IT IS. Is work exhausting? YES IT IS. But that doesn’t mean you have to see them as something that is negative in your life. Try to see college and work as a means to an end. The “end” being your long term career goal, whatever it may be.

Another thing: don’t chase money. If your long term goal is to “make bank” then you’re leading yourself to an empty and purposeless life. Money does not fulfill PERIOD. Make sure your long term goals are ones that will give you fulfillment and enjoyment. “Making bank” won’t do that for you."
,,,AShawnyBoy,"Ik it sounds like a no brainer but maybe look for an internship, even if it’s far take some time off school if need be then possibly switch a remote internship. A lot of these programs have a possibility to pay off school debt. Ex I WFH and they pay partial Tuition for school! Hope you feel better and things work out!"
,,,Tiny_Tuna1,"I feel like most, if not all, of these replies ignore something critical that you mentioned: Family. Loans money sure helps, but it does not help you or your fam in the long run. If my hunch is correct, you need to somehow address this first. Somehow. 

Either way, you work too much. Especially for someone who I assume is 20-21 y.o. with bad roommates (yes, they are bad if you gotta parent. Age don't matter). 

You got this fam."

,,,ApprehensiveOil7142,"Dump the loser roommates, they aren't helping your mental health. 

You gotta tell family you need to focus on school because you're struggling. If you're only supporting yourself and not doing the unpaid labor helping them, you'll be in much better shape. It may be hard for them to understand though, especially if you're first gen."

_meow_02,,,wikipedia_answer_bot,"**Stimulants (also known as psychostimulants or colloquially as uppers) is an overarching term that covers many drugs including those that increase the activity of the central nervous system and the body, drugs that are pleasurable and invigorating, or drugs that have sympathomimetic effects.

,,,Friendliest_Virus,"I don’t blame OP at all. (I never did in the comment section and tried to be supportive) but the lack of sexual education is appalling (again potentially not OP’s fault). If you’re gonna be sleeping around at least protect yourself with knowledge. It’ll protect you from STDs, STIs, and unwanted pregnancies. Especially me being a senior and seeing such a story from a freshman. It makes me sad someone genuinely didn’t inform them of the potential dangers of sleeping around so often and USING THE PULL OUT METHOD. GUYS- the pull out method does not exist 💀 use a condom they’re so easy to get. I’m asexual and have like 6 because my classes keep handing them out. 

I’m a kid of a single parent and feel like a child shouldn’t be had unless it’s gonna be loved and properly cared for. If she believes she can handle it, I’m all for it. I’m hoping all the best for her tbh. No one deserves go be treated like that."

So don't justify an 18 year old not knowing any better, she's 18, she admits to knowing about her family's previous teenage pregnancies, and she does later on decide to use birth control. She even admits the reason she wasn't on birth control earlier is because she didn't want her parents to know. Well she could have bought female or male condoms to use. There's no sympathy from me. Sex is nice, I'm not going to front like I'm some type of saint, but she really should know better and I didn't see a lot of slut shaming comments, I mostly saw comments calling her stupid. Which is fair because she is stupid without a doubt. She thinks using emotions instead of logical reasoning and clearly doesn't have much foresight considering she didn't use protection and thought it'd be just fine, then happens to think that there's a random family out there that will want to bankroll her child's life. It's just an overall stupid situation."
,,,AFO1031,"I am unsure whether I agree with the sentiment the man should be held liable to the decision of the woman to continue with the pregnancy. It is a decision taken by one party that will impact both forever after.

sure, the woman’s choice is important, but is it not also important that she not deciding for only herself and what’s inside her body, but also for someone else?

are we really to belive that if student A, a middle class girl that decided it's okay since they will be able to pay for a nanny while they attend class from a bit of her parent’s money, and a bit of child support, that student B a first-generation student, buried in loans, working part-time at a store should have their life derailed for her choice? 

As detailed in the first post, it did not seem like either party was aware there even was a chance of pregnancy through pulling out. Are we really to lay the decision on solely one party on how the next of his life will turn out on the decision of somebody the man met once? Is that fair? 

There was a lack of knowledge when it came to consequence, both went in with the same notion of what the encounter was. And now the monetary, and potentially social future of one of them lay’s in the other’s hands?

My body, my choice.… but also, you have to subsidize me even if I can't afford one of the choices..?

edit: also, I'm assuming the girl is not reading this, but don't take anything I just said into account. Please go see the on school therapist, they should help you navigate through this issue. I wish you the best of luck regardless of what your choice is :)"
AFO1031,,,KingDominoTheSecond,"I had the same thought process as you actually, but then I realized that having sex, protected or unprotected, is accepting the risk that this will happen. The woman gets final say because the baby will impact her body's health directly, but the man does get a say when he's deciding whether or not he's going to put his dick in her. Sex (on a biological level) ONLY exists to create children, so having sex inherently comes with that risk."
KingDominoTheSecond,,,AFO1031,"the issue in many cases is that the specific case has people that while you or I might know that doing such a thing is indeed “accepting the risk” as shown by the original post, some people don't think there's any risk 

if you are approached by a girl, and she tells you she believes pulling out is safe… is that truly an informed decision? Is that a fair assessment of risk? 

I only have sex with women who are on birth control, and even then only if we use a condom. The chances are:
Birth control: 0.001
Condom: 0.02
natural chance (1 in 20 tries): 0.95
and if we multiply all, we get 0.000019
aka, it would take around 526,31.58  for my partner to get pregnant 

I know the risk. But it's so ridiculous that… would you even then say I “accepted the risk?”

when I board an airplane I accept the tiny risk it’ll crash… does that change anything..? 

And in this case, there is a choice. The methaforical pilot can choose to… Deal with the turbulence but at the end not crash. 

If they still choose to crash… should the man’s life be forever changed? perharphs “ruined” if they are forced to drop out or anything of the sort?"
AFO1031,,,KingDominoTheSecond,"There is a risk in every single thing you do, such as riding on a plane, or driving your car, or walking down the stairs at night in the dark while you're tired. It all has risks. Luckily if you've been in the American education system (which isn't the best, admittedly, but it still has at least this) you've been educated about the risks of having sex, of relying on the pull out method, and the various forms of birth control.

And the difference between sex and riding in a car or plane is that sex's primary purpose is to make a child, whereas a car's primary purpose isn't to crash. You can take precautions to reduce the chance of pregnancy, but the fact of the matter is that you're doing an action that was created by evolution with the goal of making a baby. No matter what, you have to accept the fact that there's ALWAYS a risk of pregnancy. Always. 

And being uneducated doesn't negate that risk, it's the equivalent of clicking ""I accept the terms and conditions"" without reading them and not realizing what you just agreed to. And everyone knows that sex is an activity made to make kids, anyone could tell you that there's a risk involved, even if they have a skewed perception of what those risks are."
KingDominoTheSecond,,,AFO1031,"Everyone does know sex is to procreate yes, but as evidenced by the initial posts, and its comments, some people genuinely do believe there are perfectly safe ways to go about it, that bring no risk. Whether it's due to parents pulling kids out of sex Ed (something that happened to many people I know) or whether they attended private, or home school… or even just didn't pay attention… People are singing contracts without reading them first, and at the end, one party holds all the power to decide what happens with the other. Whether they’ll be financially, and socially burdened for the rest of their life.

Also, I disagree with your point about comparing cars and sex. Cars are “for” anything. They are what they are, massive metal machines that you can get on and then control to move very quickly. Sex is a thing that gives people pleasure

Each of them are a literal or metaphorical vehicle to some goal. And they have risks that are inherent to them. Either child birth, or crashing and that entails

there is no objective goal for activities and things. We give those things and activities goals by engineering around what we want to avoid. 

A car can be used to run people over, it could also be used as a paperweight. But we have designed it so that it can be ridden on, and won't be likely to kill you. 

Likewise, we have engineered birth control, and condoms, things that make it so only one sex act in over half a million will result in somebody getting pregnant… you are more likely to crash in a car than get somebody pregnant…

The main issue here, is that when all those protections fail, one of the two parties involved has all the power. And while they SHOULD definitely have a good part of that power, deciding whether or not to have an abortion, the fact that if they choose to birth, the other party is automatically liable for a lot of money. 

if a plane is crashing, and it has the ability to only injure those who consent, is it fair for the co-pilot to go down if he doesn't want to..? just because the pilot did?.. No, just give them both the option, and if the pilot still wants to bring the plane to a stop alongside their education, job experience, and their future prospects in love and work… Then that is a choice they made"
,,,SeedlingGroot,"Way to go. Great advice! I can't even begin to tell you how little sex Ed, which was none I came away from Catholic High School with! It was no wonder girls in our senior year just disappeared. They got pregnant and were sent away to a convent to have the baby secretly so the family wasn't shamed and wasn't even allowed to see or hold the baby. Mom was sent home and baby was adopted. I wouldn't send my children to private schools because I was so naive. I wanted my children to learn street smarts. I was date raped because I had no idea how the act of sex even happened. I certainly never thought the girl and boy were face to face."

Need Advice: Unexpected Class Cancellation cost me 16k,2023-12-20 20:35:03,Stock_Quarter_153,,
,,,Clever_Mannn,Your advisor will probably let you take 2 classes that overlap. I had many friends who would show up late to one lecture because there other class overlapped by an hour.
,,,ImprobableGallus,"Ask a professor of one of the other sections if you can take their section despite lacking the prerequisites, and if they can let your advisor know in addition to your contacting your advisor. Sometimes, advisors respond faster to faculty than to students."
,,,CN-BetaReminisce,"What is your requirement left to graduate? Planning out quarters in advance is quite difficult, because of class scheduling conflict or classes getting canceled. I ran into this issue before, though mine was milder compared to your experience since I was only attempting 4 CS + 1 Breadth. 

Do you not have prerequisites fulfilled for either of the 179 sections? You might be able to convince the professor and advisor to allow enrollment in conflicting class times. Personally, I took OS Design, and the lecture component was just explaining the labs and only met every other week.

If you aren't able to do that, chances are you could probably try for part time enrollment in Spring. It should help bring tuition cost down"
,,,SweetandSaltyFruit,Maybe talk with your academic advisor and ask if any other class can be substituted. I had the same situation with English 103. It was never offered and instead I had to take a Creative Writing course that had two prerequisites that could not be taken concurrently… luckily I changed from Holly Easley to another advisor on my last quarter. I was able to use a previous English course to fill in that requirement and I was able to graduate in Spring in time for me to apply for my masters

,,,Then-Cartographer695,"i just took this class with him, he's really lenient and would prep us well for quizzes, our only homework would be worksheets that we do in discussion (although sometimes he was really hard to follow with his poor handwriting lol)"
,,,Fine-Ad-5824,Sloppy looking notes. Incredibly lenient on grading. Not a heavy workload. I would suggest doing the weekly worksheets during office hours w a TA. Grade was based on 40 percent worksheets 30 percent on 4 biweekly quizzes and 30 percent on the final. (Our class got a B average on the final).
,,,Apprehensive_Bug9495,"the actual class itself is rly easy because all his quizzes are either exactly the quiz reviews that he posts, or v similar and theres no homework. i will say his actual lectures are a little hard to follow, but i think it was his first quarter teaching, so i assume he’ll improve. the final was very easy and heavily based on previous quizzes and the review"
,,,Botronic_Reddit,"I think he might be new, the only Professors I’ve known to teach CS011 are Javier Gonzalez and Elena S."
,,,sksksNunu,"had him this quarter, he was rough at first, but he got better as the quarter came along. his quizzes are easy, since he would just do the quiz problems in lecture with different numbers or wording. worksheets from discussions were also easy. final was 34 mcq graded out of 30, so pretty easy too. the only issue was his lectures were kinda scuffed. his handwriting was a little bad and he doesn't actually have lecture notes; he writes things on the board, and then used a student's notes on those writings as the posted lecture notes. overall easy A, but i stressed a lot in the first few weeks because i wasn't sure what to expect."

For double majoring I am a second year can I still double major? I’m currently business economics I want to do something in math or cs help!,2023-12-20 15:52:26,SevereSheepherder812,,
,,,DeerAdministrative82,You can for sure do it still and if you’re really passionate don’t let your advisor prevent you!! Some are great but others not so much. They are very strict about ensuring students graduate within 4 years and double majoring might prevent that so they’ll discourage you from doing it. I don’t know how for along you are in your degree audit but either way like I said if you really want to go for it!

,,,WaywardSon2244,"I can’t stress enough: get your IGETC certification! You’ll skip most underdiv breadth requirements, including language. 
Details:

IGETC
The Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) is a series of courses that California community college students may complete to satisfy the lower-division breadth/general education requirements before transferring to either the California State University or most colleges and majors at UC campuses.

IGETC includes 11 courses (34 semester units) in the following subjects:

English communication
Mathematical concepts and quantitative reasoning
Arts and humanities
Social and behavioral sciences
Physical and biological sciences
Language other than English
Ethnic Studies

,,,adohg1415,"I’m not BCOE, but I have been taking community college classes since freshman year of high school. CHASS student (business economics).

During high school, my school offered some courses that would give you both high school and college credits. I took culinary & biotechnology (2 years). Those gave me elective credit, accepted by UCR. 

Then, I took classes through community college as a concurrent enrollment student, and had 15 transferable credits to submit to UCR as well. 

I still take classes at CC. I have a year-long language requirement that I must satisfy, so I have been doing that through Riverside community college District. It’s much easier, and completely online (Spanish). at UCR, if you take a language course, you must attend four days a week for 50 minutes a day each time. That just didn’t make sense to me.


I encourage everyone to take whatever classes they can through community college, as it’s not only cost-effective, but also typically easier.  In order to figure out what classes you can take that are transferable, just use assist.org



This obviously goes for lower division requirements, as those are more easily accessible through community colleges. As you go further in your degree, you may not be able to find courses that are easily transferable between institutions."

I’ve heard some horror stories about math at UC so if you struggle I highly suggest taking math at a CC"

,,,PercivleOnReddit,"All of the lower division stuff for BCOE: Calculus, the science classes related to my major, and the science classes unrelated to my major. Having an extra month to learn the material is so much nicer.

Linear Algebra specifically was a good investment in the end because it's not required for transfer but was used all the time jn my major.

I also did all of my other requirements (IGETC) at CC so I didn't need to do anything but the upper division Breadth courses and my major stuff at UCR."

You will seriously save yourself a ton of money and there’s few downsides so long as you map the courses on assist and keep a close eye on your TAG requirements

But for changes in difficulty, I completed my math and physics requirements in CC for my BCOE major and anecdotally noticed no difference in difficulty from students I talked to. My major-specific transfer prereqs in CC had huge gaps in material but my CC was notably terrible for my major with a lot of courses not even being eligible to transfer credits for, so this wasn’t a surprise"

UCRDonkey,,,[deleted],"Agreed, but I feel like this says a lot about the expectations being placed on students. I’ve never cheated, but I also only take 12 units per quarter for this EXACT reason. Even with 12 units, I have to pull all nighters at least one a week or two weeks to get my work done. Professors (at this school, considering it is pretty low ranked among other UC’s)ask wayy too much from their students. I have been in classes where professors will ask students to complete a programming assignment, lab and study for a quiz all within the same week while learning new content a week before the midterm. With the quarter system at UCR, I really dont retain all that information crammed in 10 weeks past the final and even worse, the same students trying to graduate on time are sacrificing sleep and STILL feel the need to cheat."

,,,sc4rplatinum,"By posting anything on any online forum, people are going to be giving advice. That is just the way it is whether you like it or not. Even your centrist take that could lead to indecision or absentmindedness for this woman can be considered advice.

Also, she is very clearly distraught about the possibility of having this child and is only being prevented from breaking this familial trend (that she also feels very negatively about, in case that wasn’t clear through her post) because of a fear of God. Naturally, people are going to try to convince her that she should resort to abortion; it’s the most sound decision for her situation.

I’m sure God will forgive her and I’m sure she’s going to forgive herself soon enough. It’d be a hell of a lot better than trying to take care of a child you don’t have the resources or time to take care of."

An update to the pregnancy saga,2023-12-20 00:02:40,Jesse4Lyfe,,
,,,ChickenCliks,Man I’m moreso worried about that fetuses development. She mentioned she got wasted at parties and if she was 12 weeks pregnant while posting that was DURING her pregnancy…
ChickenCliks,,,SweetandSaltyFruit,My mom said she drank for 3 months throughout Mexico a many nights before she knew she was pregnant with me. I'm alright and the same can be said about this girl
SweetandSaltyFruit,,,Jesse4Lyfe,"While you may have turned out alright the alcohol certainly negatively affected your development, to say otherwise is foolish.

You should also know that you can't use anecdotal evidence to support a claim."
Jesse4Lyfe,,,SweetandSaltyFruit,Yes and there’s no need to freak out a community that knows the realities of fetal alcohol syndrome. Freaking out that they drank a lot in the beginning of her pregnancy on a post that is basically shaming her into aborting her child.
,,,madkandy12,"My mom gave away my little sister for an open adoption and let me tell you, that kid is fucked up. Imagine knowing your family gave you away and you have to know them. You have to know they exist and they don’t want you. Imagine having to go visit your real family just to go back “home” to this house of strangers. My older sister and I are 7 and 8 years older than her so she had to come visit her fun older siblings for birthdays and holidays then had to leave. Imagine seeing your mother, the one who gave you away and didn’t want you, several times a year. Imagine seeing your happy and regular and alive family knowing they are living without you since they didn’t want you. My little sister has terrible depression, anxiety and identity issues. She feels abandoned and unwanted. She feels like a burden to everyone around her. And none of it is her fault. 

My mom made a shitty decision that has only lead to disappointment, depression and life long consequences for all of her children. She’s just setting up this poor child for a life of despair. If you can’t take care of a child, don’t have it. The trauma of adoption on a child isn’t worth “I don’t want an abortion :( “ How you feel and the guilt you’ll feel is nothing compared to ruining the life of a WHOLE person, an 80 year long consequence, bc of YOUR mistake."
,,,candyflossy96,"It's more of an issue that she seems misinformed about what an open adoption means.

You have zero rights as a birth parent, ZERO. You are not a ""bonus parent"" or a parent at all. The child's parents/family can cut off contact with you for any reason at any time. It's their child and how much they allow you is entirely up to their discretion and judgement. 

Tyler and Catelynn Baltierra have an extensively documented outcome on the dark side of open adoption. They were manipulated by a Christian adoption service to give up their child under the guise of an open adoption, and had fantasies similar to this UCR girl. The adoptive parents severely limited contact after her first birthday, and for several years have cut off contact with Tyler and Catelynn. talk about intensely traumatic."
,,,[deleted],"Uff. Reality doesn't hit you until the baby you bond with is wheeled out after delivery. My friend did an adoption because she's religious and she regrets it to this day. She described the above feeling as excruciating. Her body was altered forever as well and she went into a depression over it. Her identity was fashion and after the child she just can't wear what she used to without working out and dieting like crazy.

Given that perspective I really don't think doing an adoption is morally higher or remotely a solution. Whatever OP decides she'll have to live with, I just fear she may be too immature to really see the reality of carrying a child to term and how painful the delivery and giving up rights is. Whereas in an abortion you deal with your guilt, it kind of ends at you. Giving a child up for adoption involves more complicated and lifelong feelings and in this day and age the child will most likely find you and try to have a relationship whether you signed the rights over or not. Just big uff all around. Saying a prayer for this young woman"

,,,Ninothesloth,"You know what at this point it’s her body her choice. Would’ve I done the same, no. I would’ve lied to my family gotten an abortion and moved on. I just hope her and her baby turns out to be well at this point."
Ninothesloth,,,Jesse4Lyfe,"You're right, stupid is as stupid does I suppose.

At the very least, I can assure you that the child will be well taken care of in her household. I'm almost positive her parents will not be okay with her giving the child up for adoption. That's just how Mexicans are."
Jesse4Lyfe,,,Ninothesloth,Well my mom had me at 18. My parents were a young military couple so it was common to get married at 17-18 and to have kids at 18-19. My dad got his degree thanks to the GI bill and My mom still got her degree later on in life and became a social worker. My grandma was 19 when she had my mom and later she got her masters. So she can still go to medical school later on in life even if she chooses.
Jesse4Lyfe,,,wubbun,thats how typical traditional hispanics are because im mexican but my parents were born here and my dad is definitely way more open to abortion and things like this my mom a little less but shed learn to accept over time

Training_Pumpkin3650,,,Jesse4Lyfe,"You start showing in the second trimester, the OP of that post is approaching that phase of the pregnancy in a few days."
Jesse4Lyfe,,,kat-kat-kat-kat,"This. And some people have a retroverted uterus where it tilts backwards instead of forwards, meaning that you show later. People with longer torsos also tend to show later. People who aren’t thin also don’t tend to show as noticeably early on. People who are pregnant for the first time don’t tend to show very early on either. There are so many factors at play."
,,,Fast_Fan_936,"A girl like her is such a letdown. The younger generations are fucked man. I thought it was bad people now cheat so often on finals and midterms, settling for low grades for degrees (I’m no different) because a genuine workplace doesn’t value degrees anymore. Then I look behind myself and see the increasingly corrupted youth. Maybe it’s not as bad for folks who live in wealthy areas, but I’m certain that girl lives in a poor Latino community like so many of us do, and the poor do not get smarter by being poor. It’s so frustrating hearing her basically throw away a foundational stepping stone for a bright future just because she can’t exercise proper sexual precautions."

also, I would not try to judge whether or not she’ll succeed at her career during something like this… It is inappropriate and unhelpful.

Again, before making a decision she should go the on site therapist and have a talk with them. They should be able to help her navigate through her feelings, choices, and if she wishes, provide her with information regarding those choices"
,,,LeadingDefiant3361,"First off, the way you worded your post is weird. 

We’re all a family about this now.

Weirdo. 

Second of all, OP of that original post has a right to do whatever she wants with her body. No one cares if you think it’s a terrible idea. As long as she does her own research into open adoption, follows the correct steps, and sees it’s the best decision, then who are we to say it’s wrong. 
 
Third of all, the fact you made this post and others commenting it’s a bad decision to go with open adoption is concerning. Why do you care? It will affect your life in no way, shape, or form. You can disagree with her choice but it’s HER choice. There’s no reason to be upset about that commenter saying to go with open adoption. They were just offering solutions, which is what everyone on that post did. It was obvious OP of that post was having reservations, which is why they didn’t go with abortion. 

OP of that post can do whatever she wants. If it will give her a peace of mind, let her do it."
LeadingDefiant3361,,,Jesse4Lyfe,"I was making a lighthearted joke in the context of a serious situation.

People certainly do care, as others have echoed my sentiments. We've personally seen the same situation play out time and time again and it always ends up the same. We're trying to save this young girl from the generational curse that has plagued so many of our own families. 

Again, I care because I can see my cousin making that post. I can see my friend's sister making that post. Yeah it doesn't affect me one way or the other you're right, but it sucks knowing the outcome and seeing a person walk down that path when there is currently a way to stop walking down that path. Once she walks down far enough though there is no coming back. 

It is upsetting seeing a person make a foolish choice, in the same way I'm sure my post upset you. You felt the need to comment because my post resonated with you, albeit negatively. Well the girl's post raised serious alarm bells in my head.

When did I say she couldn't do whatever she wants? She can do whatever she wants, and I can also say she's making stupid choices.

I'll ask the same of you. Why do you care? My post doesn't affect your life in any way, shape, or form."
LeadingDefiant3361,,,KingDominoTheSecond,"Yeah it's her choice but how much can the choice of someone like her be trusted when it was her choices that lead her into the position she's in right now? I'm just saying, maybe some people need a little more guidance and less autonomy than others."
,,,Upstairs-King-4483,"Yeah I get ur point but the thing is that if she’s choosing the open adoption route, then it’s probably likely she’s not comfortable with getting the abortion AND THAT’S VALID. 

“The easiest and safest option with the lowest risk and had the chance of her succeeding was to simply abort the child”

At the end of the day she gets to choose what she wants. This is starting to read as pressuring her to get the abortion vs actually being pro choice and respecting what she wants to do with her body. Both options will suck to some degree, but you CAN’T tell her in absolute in what her future may look like. Some women regret their abortions during their whole lives, some don’t give a fuck. Some women can’t imagine life without having their child, some can. She chose the BEST OPTION FOR HER because what she wants isn’t what YOU want. And if she’s choosing this, then it’s likely she’d be unhappier choosing the abortion. If you want to get one yourself, fine, do it, that’s your choice. But she doesn’t want to because of whatever feelings she has, and her beliefs are her own and NOT yours. You can’t project your own beliefs onto her, and neither can she to you. 

And for those questioning open adoptions, MOST adoptions in the US are open adoptions for a reason. They’re more common than closed adoptions because the pros of open adoptions outweigh its cons. There’s more healing for the birth mother, the child gets to know their ancestry and biological family, and not “left wondering,” and more. That’s why in the US, 95% OF INFANT ADOPTIONS ARE OPEN ADOPTIONS. And infants gets adopted pretty fast, I think you guys are thinking of older children in foster care that don’t. There’s around 2 million couples that are waiting to adopt a baby. One reason they want to is bc of infertility. That’s more common than you think, especially since more people are waiting to have kids and then menopause hits and well shit it looks like you can’t have kids. 

I don’t care. downvote me to hell, but you guys should accept that there are more options that can WORK for her than you think. There’s semi-open adoptions that can work for her as well. Giving her these options is the the WHOLE point in being pro-choice 

And also, you can become a doctor and be a mom. This is coming from someone who is also premed and getting ready to apply. I’ve seen countless non-traditional and traditional applicants who are moms. Many of us don’t even apply right after graduation. The average age is 24 to matriculate in. Everyone does things on their own time. If she has the perseverance to get through something as scary as this, then I believe she will grow into a fine woman who can get through medical school and become a doctor. You can’t put limits on people you barely know."

,,,eloise_reads,"As a kid whose parents were both teens, I don't think it's the end of the world if she has the baby. Yes, school will be extremely difficult and she may need to take a leave from school, and that leave may last a few years. But UCR is always going to be there! She can reapply in a few years if she really needs to take the time off financially to support her child. I understand the concern of everyone posting, and I was was agreeing with the people suggesting abortion, but at this point y'all are getting to the point of insensitive and cruel. Having a baby is not the end of the world! She just needs to make sure she knows the consequences of keeping the baby (and I agree that open adoption would not be the best decision). She is going to need to work 100x times as hard to support herself and her baby, but the love she gives her child is what will matter in the end.

She worked super hard to support me and it took her 10 years to get her A.A. from community college because she was working and doing night classes when she could. But when you have the drive and the love, you can do anything. For OP, It sounded like her family loves her, and yes they may be religious, but once they see her baby I'm sure they're going to love it like their own. (This is me being optimistic since y'all are debby downers)

My point is, she is choosing to have the baby, it is her decision, her body, and you guys need to respect that. I'm pro-choice, and she made her choice. Y'all need to back off with the insensitive comments. I understand the concern, but we just need to support her. Because if she can get into UCR with hard work, she can support herself and figure out what she needs to next. 

(And yes, I am first-gen UCR alumni, and I'm currently pursuing my master's at UCLA... all because my ""dumb"" young mom made the ""dumb"" decision to keep me. My mom is now an entrepreneur and owns her own small business! Things are still hard, but she always make me proud by how hard she works to support me)"
,,,SweetandSaltyFruit,My mom said she drank for 3 months throughout Mexico a many nights before she knew she was pregnant with me. I'm alright and the same can be said about this girl
SweetandSaltyFruit,,,Jesse4Lyfe,"While you may have turned out alright the alcohol certainly negatively affected your development, to say otherwise is foolish.

You should also know that you can't use anecdotal evidence to support a claim."
Jesse4Lyfe,,,SweetandSaltyFruit,Yes and there’s no need to freak out a community that knows the realities of fetal alcohol syndrome. Freaking out that they drank a lot in the beginning of her pregnancy on a post that is basically shaming her into aborting her child.
,,,RevelryByNight,Abortion doesn’t always come with depression and mental consequences. Sometimes it comes with relief and happiness.
RevelryByNight,,,Constant-Visual-2913,It’s temporary relief because you never get over it (I would know…)

Being prescriptive about how all people *will feel* isn’t helpful or accurate. (I would know…)"
,,,Jesse4Lyfe,"You're right, stupid is as stupid does I suppose.

At the very least, I can assure you that the child will be well taken care of in her household. I'm almost positive her parents will not be okay with her giving the child up for adoption. That's just how Mexicans are."
Jesse4Lyfe,,,Ninothesloth,Well my mom had me at 18. My parents were a young military couple so it was common to get married at 17-18 and to have kids at 18-19. My dad got his degree thanks to the GI bill and My mom still got her degree later on in life and became a social worker. My grandma was 19 when she had my mom and later she got her masters. So she can still go to medical school later on in life even if she chooses.
Jesse4Lyfe,,,wubbun,thats how typical traditional hispanics are because im mexican but my parents were born here and my dad is definitely way more open to abortion and things like this my mom a little less but shed learn to accept over time
,,,Jesse4Lyfe,"You start showing in the second trimester, the OP of that post is approaching that phase of the pregnancy in a few days."
Jesse4Lyfe,,,kat-kat-kat-kat,"This. And some people have a retroverted uterus where it tilts backwards instead of forwards, meaning that you show later. People with longer torsos also tend to show later. People who aren’t thin also don’t tend to show as noticeably early on. People who are pregnant for the first time don’t tend to show very early on either. There are so many factors at play."
,,,[deleted],Some people shouldn’t be allowed to have kids Fr Fr (this is 80% a joke)
,,,Jesse4Lyfe,"I was making a lighthearted joke in the context of a serious situation.

People certainly do care, as others have echoed my sentiments. We've personally seen the same situation play out time and time again and it always ends up the same. We're trying to save this young girl from the generational curse that has plagued so many of our own families. 

Again, I care because I can see my cousin making that post. I can see my friend's sister making that post. Yeah it doesn't affect me one way or the other you're right, but it sucks knowing the outcome and seeing a person walk down that path when there is currently a way to stop walking down that path. Once she walks down far enough though there is no coming back. 

It is upsetting seeing a person make a foolish choice, in the same way I'm sure my post upset you. You felt the need to comment because my post resonated with you, albeit negatively. Well the girl's post raised serious alarm bells in my head.

When did I say she couldn't do whatever she wants? She can do whatever she wants, and I can also say she's making stupid choices.

I'll ask the same of you. Why do you care? My post doesn't affect your life in any way, shape, or form."
,,,KingDominoTheSecond,"Yeah it's her choice but how much can the choice of someone like her be trusted when it was her choices that lead her into the position she's in right now? I'm just saying, maybe some people need a little more guidance and less autonomy than others."
,,,dollpartsss_,She responded to a comment saying that she canceled her abortion apt & will instead opt for an open adoption
,,,akangaroohoo,To be fair- in her post she goes quite in depth on how having this baby would not work for her.
akangaroohoo,,,SweetandSaltyFruit,"Yeah but this post is way over the top. Her rant was coming from a place of panic. She's a young mom, of course there are a million reasons why it wouldn't work. I don't believe she should be discouraged from choosing an abortion, but the opposite should be true too."
SweetandSaltyFruit,,,akangaroohoo,"I can see your point. Well, at least the post acknowledges that they're coming off very pessimistic."
,,,KingDominoTheSecond,"Who hasn't made similar mistakes??? You're talking like it's normal to go ""whoopsie! I accidentally had unprotected sex with multiple people even though my family has a history of teenage pregnancy and I've seen first hand the consequences of being a teen mother. And whoopsies I accidentally jeopardized an opportunity that no other woman in my family has had because I felt like having sex without any condom!! tee hee silly me oh well it happens to everyone"""

[deleted],,,[deleted],">Why gamble with your future 

Again, coming here is already a loss imo so i see dropping out to go to a CC a no lose situation. It's dirt easy to transfer here anyway so either you do well enough to go somewhere better or just come back here or somewhere comparable like cal poly or sdsu"
,,,adohg1415,"Honestly you haven’t even experienced ucr yet, this school is really fucking nice. We have everything new and awesome people. You should at least give it a chance. Also transferring to ucla is hard as fuck good luck, as you’re not a priority applicant for transfer compared to cc students."
,,,boyyoustupid,"tbh if you are willing to go through the steps to transfer then do it. only a few are able to navigate transferring from UC to UC. there is no seperate system built for us like CCs cuz we are already at a great 4 year institution. counselors won’t help you much. even the other UC counselors do not help or say do not call in or email (i experienced that). plus when you transfer, not all your classes go through or u have more requirements at the school you transfer to that you didn’t have to take at UCR. i had friends who had to take up an extra year or quarters because not everything transfers over. also you have to make new friends and a network. it depends on your major obviously but it is super hard to make new friends as a transfer. if CC kids kind of struggle, then imagine us. if you want to do it, then do it. there is no harm in trying but the process is not easy at all. i think that is half of the reason why the percentage of UC to UC transfer is so low because people give up half way through with the process and with that the number of applicants are really really small. the ones who do are the one who thugged it out lol. experience UCR first, join clubs, and meet new people. the things you see and experience in your first year usually do not happen again. so take advantage and work on transferring alongside it. trust me i love ucr and i dont want to transfer cuz of the ppl. keep an open mind and try ur best. good luck!"
,,,[deleted],"Seeing as you can't even write  - ""accepted"" not excepted - you won't go anywhere and you might not even finish from here lol. 

Also does transferring to UCLA easier since I’m in UCR?

No in fact it makes it way harder. UC to UC transfers are the LAST priority. 

I don't get why there are so many of you who don't want to come here but still enroll here in hopes of transferring out. Like that makes me want to say non pc words with how dumb that is.

As a tax payer it kinda pisses me off too because you could've saved so much money just going to cc and that would've been better for everyone"
[deleted],,,GasPump87,was the typo insult really necessary bruh?
,,,[deleted],"There are a few things you need to do. Look on assist.org for your desired major, plug in the UC’s you want to go to, plug in a random community college and evaluate the prerequisites you need to take. These courses must be finished by spring of soph year, and vary between UC’s. You will then need to consider the courses that UCR offers that are equivalent to the prerequisites required by  the UC’s. For example, if Calculus 1 and 2 are required, you will need to complete the Calc 9 series. To be eligible for junior level transfer, you will need to complete 90 quarter units before spring quarter of your sophomore year. You should search up « UC TRANSFER BY MAJOR » to get an idea of the average GPA for students admitted into the major you want to study at the schools you want to go to. Aim to be within this range/average GPA provided to you by this website. Apply the fall quarter of your sophomore year. Good luck. And no, transferring to UCLA will not be easier because you go to UCR. UCLA is a selective school. Don’t let people discourage you from transferring if you feel like you could do better. People have their reasons for attending UCR instead of a CC and similarly have their reasons for transferring."
,,,GullibleActuary1229,"Transferring to UCSD or UCI is doable, if you’re smart and can time manage. Transferring to UCLA is hard as fuck (coming from someone who has a friend that went UCR -> UCLA). No social life, you NEED to get good grades, failing any class or getting C/D could cost you the chance of transferring (from what I heard). TBH, see how UCR is, if you realize you can’t live with UCR, aim for UCSD or UCI which actually have decent odds."

Again, coming here is already a loss imo so i see dropping out to go to a CC a no lose situation. It's dirt easy to transfer here anyway so either you do well enough to go somewhere better or just come back here or somewhere comparable like cal poly or sdsu"

[deleted],,,[deleted],Clearly you’re not a mathematician bases on your other comments. You’re just bitter and discourage people from transferring between UC’s for some reason.

I think people SHOULD transfer by dropping out and going to a CC and doing it that way."
[deleted],,,[deleted],"The thing is, if you want to transfer to an impact major, sometimes its safer to just go to a 4 year to insure you’ll leave with a degree and take your chances with other colleges during your 2nd year.

Upper Division Classes,2023-12-19 22:42:52,Wild-Assist-2897,,
,,,Efficient-Put9162,"as long as that upper div is not a pre req you need a C- in for anything you should get credit for that class, but it might also depend on your major/school so check w an advisor or school website"
,,,ViciousGreen,C’s get degrees
,,,inversemodel,"As far as I know, the rule is you need an upper div GPA above 2.0 to graduate, rather than Cs in all your classes. 

So depending on grades in other classes, and (as others have said) so long as you don't need it as a prereq, maybe you can get away with it."
,,,GullibleActuary1229,"Depends on college. BCOE allows a D+ for upper div pre-recs, but you do need > 2.5 gpa in upper div classes to graduate (it might be 2.0 I forgot)"
Is there a process for retaking a course you failed or is it simple?,2023-12-19 22:33:41,qykor,,
,,,Efficient-Put9162,"you can just register for it again 

you’d only need to talk to an advisor if you’re taking the same class for a third time"
,,,PersonalSwan3836,"1. Talk to your advisor to see if they approve it or not. If it’s your third time taking the course they probably won’t let you retake it but you can probably appeal it. 

2. Fill out your designated college(BCOE, CNAS,CHASS) woofu form and submit.(you need the specific class information in order to fill out the form). 

3. Wait for a response (usually takes 1-2 business days)

4. As soon as you get the green light you can register for it!!! 

5. Yippie!!!"
,,,mechasmadness,"You should be able to register for it again without issue since you failed; if you do run into issues, just let your advisor know so they can override the system"

is there a way to ask for a grade change,2023-12-19 19:18:58,Own-Statistician2033,,
,,,Botronic_Reddit,"Yeah just email them, one of my Profs made a mistake which gave me and some students the wrong grade so they corrected them after receiving emails.

Just say you calculated your grade to be an A- based on the syllabus and that you received a B+ instead so you want to know if there was a mistake."
,,,soggy-cheetos,"Philosophy TA here! (not for this class though) If you think there’s been a mistake then you should email your TA. We try to be careful but we’re all human, so mistakes can and do happen. It doesn’t hurt to ask and if it turns out that your final grade is a B+ then at least you don’t have to worry about it anymore. If it turns out it should have been an A- then someone can fix it for you. Don’t be afraid to advocate for yourself! 

Good luck & happy holidays :)"
